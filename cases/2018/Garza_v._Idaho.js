As we note on page 32 of our opening brief, Mr. Garza here has a very colorable, I think meritorious claim, that his appeal waiver was involuntary. We address the specific facts there, which include shortly before his second plea, indicating on a form that he was not waiving his right to appeal; going into two plea hearings, neither of which inquired, as required under state law under Rule 11, into whether he was waiving his right to appeal; and then being advised three times in -- once in the hearing and twice in judgments, that he had a right to appeal. And -- and I just want to note that that claim could not be raised on post-conviction.", "start": 3586.84, "stop": 3627.04, "duration": 40.2, "cleanText": [["and", "i", "just", "want", "to", "do", "it", "on", "the", "context", "of", "this", "record", "with", "the", "real", "practical", "consequence", "this", "could", "have", "for", "mr", "garza"], ["as", "we", "note", "on", "page", "of", "our", "open", "brief", "mr", "garza", "here", "have", "a", "very", "colorable", "i", "think", "meritorious", "claim", "that", "his", "appeal", "waiver", "be", "involuntary"], ["we", "address", "the", "specific", "fact", "there", "which", "include", "shortly", "before", "his", "second", "plea", "indicate", "on", "a", "form", "that", "he", "be", "not", "waive", "his", "right", "to", "appeal", "go", "into", "two", "plea", "hearing", "neither", "of", "which", "inquired", "as", "require", "under", "state", "law", "under", "rule", "into", "whether", "he", "be", "waive", "his", "right", "to", "appeal", "and", "then", "be", "advise", "three", "time", "in", "once", "in", "the", "hearing", "and", "twice", "in", "judgment", "that", "he", "have", "a", "right", "to", "appeal"], ["and", "and", "i", "just", "want", "to", "note", "that", "that", "claim", "could", "not", "be", "raise", "on", "post", "conviction"]]}, {"text": "Justice Alito, you asked whether it was raised and dealt with.", "start": 3627.04, "stop": 3629.64, "duration": 2.6, "cleanText": [["justice", "alito", "you", "ask", "whether", "it", "be", "raise", "and", "deal", "with"]]}, {"text": "The answer is no.
