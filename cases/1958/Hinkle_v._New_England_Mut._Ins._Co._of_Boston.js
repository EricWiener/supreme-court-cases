directed verdict, they didn't say he wasn't, they said he isn't according to our underwriting rules and practices, well the contract doesn't say he has to be insurable according to our underwriting

conclusive proof.","start":3275.102,"stop":3292.973,"duration":17.87},{"text":"Now I don't claim that he could send in conclusive proof, it doesn't say he had to, and they testify also that what they

(Inaudible), the medical examination had gone in and he was of good health, the medical examination would have shown it and if the medical examination showed he is in good health then they did have satisfactory evidence with their own doctor saying that he had satisfactory evidence that he was insurable and the testimony is that even with these airplane activities he still was insurable for every amount they had -- well I did use the word eligible but I don't see any difference, he was eligible for insurance for every plan they had and for every amount they had, but they said it will cost him a little more money.","start":3304.144,"stop":3346.741,"duration":42.6},{"text":"Now they want to define this word rating, and I think judge, the judges wrote in their knowledge, their guess
