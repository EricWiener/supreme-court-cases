period.","start":676.239,"stop":705.198,"duration":28.96},{"text":"Now, against that background, any provision for an untimely appeal for excusable neglect would have been a marked departure from the

the second preliminary draft or in all the various articles that the commentators that drafted the rules have written, explaining the rules which suggests that they were granting to the Court the power to allow an untimely appeal, except for this one comment which even further clarified their intent not to allow an untimely appeal.","start":765.692,"stop":805.72,"duration":40.03},{"text":"And that is, that in the first preliminary draft of the rules, there was a very limited provision for extension of time, that's on page 22 of our brief, and this provided that when a Court imposes sentence upon the represented by counsel, appointed by the Court or not represented by counsel, the Court shall ask for defendant whether he wishes to appeal.","start":805.72,"stop":843.25,"duration":37.53},{"text":"If the defendant answers in the affirmative, the Court shall direct the clerk forth with to prepare, file and serve on behalf of the defendant a notice of appeal and then, this is the crucial thing or shall extend the time specified by the rule for filling the notice of appeal.","start":843.25,"stop":863.154,"duration":19.9},{"text":"In accordance with that, at the top of page 23 of our brief, Rule 45 which proposed Rule 45 (b), equivalent of it, as it was proposed in the first draft said, \"But, the Court may not enlarge the period for taking an appeal except as provided in Rule 35 (a) (2), which was the number of the appeal rule in that first draft.","start":863.154,"stop":892.643,"duration":29.49},{"text":"Now, that very limited provision for an extension of time was dropped by the second draft of the rules and never

appeal for him, so that this obviously represented a deliberate decision although the reason for it was not commented on the notes of the second draft, but it was there, the first set was circulated and then it was dropped.","start":904.097,"stop":930.265,"duration":26.17},{"text":"So that, it is perfectly clear that the revisers knew how to draft the provision for an extension of -- or allowing untimely appeal if they want to do it or allowing an extension, and they decided not to.","start":930.265,"stop":946.398,"duration":16.13},{"text":"And we have still one (Inaudible) guide to the

Criminal Rules, that's on page 25 of our brief, they provided much as Rule 45 be does now, the Court may not enlarge the period for taking any action under specific rules or the period for taking an appeal as provided by law.","start":959.701,"stop":989.672,"duration":29.97},{"text":"And under the Civil Rules which were the model of 45 (b), the cases up to that time had held that the time for

below.","start":1018.084,"stop":1029.054,"duration":10.97},{"text":"The only other point that might be said to agree with the opinion of the -- I -- I think the idea must have come from this fact which I was going to talk about, which is that in 1948, when the Civil Rules were amended in the refining process that does come about when rules are being reconsidered, the word \"enlarge\" in Rule (6) of the Federal Rule was changed to extend.","start":1029.054,"stop":1066.878,"duration":37.82},{"text":"And the notes to the advisory committees on those rules say, at page 26 of our brief, the phrase “extend the time” is substituted for “enlarged period” because the former is a more suitable expression and relates more clearly to those Clauses (1) and (2).","start":1066.878,"stop":1092.746,"duration":25.87},{"text":"But I want to point out which I think we didn't mention in the brief that this refinement didn't even the current of

preliminary draft which contains three alternatives about -- how to handle this problem or continue to use the term \"enlarge\" in a way which I think leaves no room for doubt that there were referring to both (1) and (2) that is enlargement during the period or extending the time after the termination of the period.","start":1105.563,"stop":1131.03,"duration":25.47},{"text":"And it wasn't

subdivision (1) and as I say particularly, it was thinking about intent of the drafters.","start":1145.302,"stop":1185.975,"duration":40.67},{"text":"But absence of comments, the fact, while they're coming in on all sorts of minor changes like extending the time for five to 10 days, but the absence of any suggestion that they were departing from what have been the 12 year -- year experience of a
