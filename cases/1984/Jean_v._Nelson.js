unclear.","start":193.978,"stop":196.75,"duration":2.77},{"text":"I think they remanded it back to determine whether or not it was discrimination with respect to the 400 people, but they paid lip service to that discrimination because they did it under a standard which in effect is a narrow standard, appropriate in other contexts such as the substantive review of a decision, as Justice Blackmun found in Kleindienst versus Mandel, of the Attorney General.","start":196.75,"stop":220.038,"duration":23.29},{"text":"But it is not clear what the ultimate outcome of that review would be,

1,700.","start":220.038,"stop":240.291,"duration":20.25},{"text":"So those 1,700 petitioners that are still part of this class are subject to being incarcerated again, and we have no reason to

said.","start":324.475,"stop":330.348,"duration":5.87},{"text":"Secondly, with respect to the grounds on which the Court of Appeals remanded the case, they remanded it under a facially legitimate and bona fide standard.","start":330.348,"stop":342.086,"duration":11.74},{"text":"That standard is not sufficient to protect against race and nationality discrimination, because that standard, while appropriate in the context of such cases as Fiallo versus Bell and in Kleindienst versus Mandel, where the Court paid great deference to the decisions of Congress and the Attorney General, is inappropriate where Congress has spoken, where the President and the Attorney General have spoken, and where low-level officials have discriminated
