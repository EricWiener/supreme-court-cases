magistrate.","start":80.129,"stop":84.094,"duration":3.96},{"text":"At least one other lineup was held on March 8, 1965 some eight days later at which time the petitioner was again identified by the son of the manager of the grocery store, still, he had been taken before a magistrate.","start":84.094,"stop":97.71,"duration":13.62},{"text":"For 10 days, the petitioner was held without taken before

robbery.","start":97.71,"stop":112.129,"duration":14.42},{"text":"At the trial of this cause the sole incriminating -- the sole evidence used against him was this lineup evidence, this illegal lineup

have.","start":158.994,"stop":162.274,"duration":3.28}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"I thought in reading the briefs and without calling them that the record did show that he

facts.","start":183.161,"stop":185.265,"duration":2.1}]},{"speakerName":"Phillip Goldman","textObjs":[{"text":"No, I say this is an argument advanced by that but the record does not reflect that the

photographs.","start":185.265,"stop":200.774,"duration":15.51},{"text":"No less than the record does it say that the person he identified was the petitioner Carmine Vincent Palmieri, no less than the

record.","start":208.189,"stop":212.33,"duration":4.14},{"text":"The record does show that the son was taken down -- the first person who was arrested when the son was taken down he couldn't identify him.","start":212.33,"stop":219.265,"duration":6.93},{"text":"So, if we're going to make an inference with solid record it is that the photograph which was identified by the father was not that of the petitioner.","start":219.265,"stop":226.166,"duration":6.9},{"text":"But the record is silent on that point.","start":226.166,"stop":230.028,"duration":3.86},{"text":"Now, the record reveals and this is a reflection on the lineup that they robber was described initially as a small person, a person of about 130 pounds, about 5'6” and at least one of the lineups -- they've made a lineup where there were no small people in the lineup except the petitioner.","start":230.028,"stop":246.314,"duration":16.29},{"text":"And the prosecuting witness indicated that he picked out the smallest person in the lineup which we say goes to the dubious reliability of the lineup.","start":246.314,"stop":255.249,"duration":8.94},{"text":"It is also in the record that the father and the son told the story to the police together and it's also in the record that he had only one to two minutes to observe the time.","start":255.249,"stop":264.298,"duration":9.05},{"text":"Now, the state suggest in its brief that the procedure used in the case was similar to a procedure approved by this Court in Simmons versus United States.","start":264.298,"stop":272.403,"duration":8.11},{"text":"I respectfully submit that that just isn't the case.","start":272.403,"stop":275.497,"duration":3.09},{"text":"The Simmons case involves the use of a pretrial photograph, the identification of it.","start":275.497,"stop":280.195,"duration":4.7},{"text":"It does not involve the use of an illegal lineup.","start":280.195,"stop":284.677,"duration":4.48},{"text":"Now, despite the continued objections and cross station of petitioner's trial counsel, the illegal lineup evidence was used against the petitioner and as a result although this is important as colloquy in the record it shows that the judge would not allow the jury to hear the discussions as to the defects in the lineup.","start":284.677,"stop":303.854,"duration":19.18},{"text":"But nevertheless, the jury would turn the verdict of guilt and he was sentenced to 20 years in prison.","start":303.854,"stop":308.32,"duration":4.47}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"What is it the fashion that you can say

court.","start":474.155,"stop":479.496,"duration":5.34},{"text":"An appeal was taken to the Third District Court of Appeal which is in the Florida setup with normally be defined Appellate Court.","start":479.496,"stop":487.014,"duration":7.52},{"text":"That court's opinion after reviewing the sequence of advance conclude that shows on the face of it that it was upset with the wrongs

basis.","start":497.939,"stop":512.563,"duration":14.62},{"text":"But they had some reservations and under the Florida Constitution Article V, Section 4, they certified the question to the Supreme Court of Florida and the question of great public interest.","start":512.563,"stop":523.138,"duration":10.58},{"text":"Under the Supreme Court of Florida, affirmed again and they answered the question

the trial was the evidence which was developed during the unlawful detention.","start":543.773,"stop":554.176,"duration":10.4},{"text":"The court also noted that the petitioner hadn't requested to be taken before a magistrate and based its decision in part on that, actually the record on this point is silent and as this Court have stated in Conley decision, a waiver cannot be inferred, it's not permissive from the silent record.","start":554.176,"stop":573.195,"duration":19.02},{"text":"The record here is silent.","start":573.195,"stop":575.386,"duration":2.19},{"text":"Also in the Conley

Court, the state continues to rely on the fact of a lack of prejudicial error and as I submitted it before if this man had been taken before a magistrate as required by law under Section 901.23 of the

place.","start":591.396,"stop":617.007,"duration":25.61},{"text":"The only other point is the point suggested by Mr. Justice Stewart from that perhaps there had been this identification but as I

mandate.","start":654.765,"stop":663.006,"duration":8.24},{"text":"Now, as this Court knows that McNabb-Mallory Rule stems with the decision of this Court which holds that if the dependant is unlawfully detained in violation of Rule 5 (a) of the Federal Criminal Rules and Procedure that evidence gathered during that time cannot be used in the conviction based on such evidence will be reversed.","start":663.006,"stop":681.546,"duration":18.54},{"text":"Similar provisions in the form of legislation requiring that arrested person to be promptly taken before magistrate exists and practically every State in the Union I have collected in the footnote of those cases in our brief.","start":681.546,"stop":694.39,"duration":12.84},{"text":"Interestingly enough as that point out in

I'm sure the Attorney General can tell you since this decision.","start":700.379,"stop":704.588,"duration":4.21},{"text":"The Supreme Court of Florida has in a number of cases continued to ignore the provisions of 901.23.","start":704.588,"stop":711.931,"duration":7.34},{"text":"Now, although McNabb-Mallory Rule has been a rule applicable to federal court proceedings, I think its an interesting coincidence that in the case Milton versus Cochran which is a Supreme Court of Florida case, the Supreme Court resided that if it didn't start to do something about stopping this failure to take the man before magistrate that this Court of some other federal court would adopt the McNabb-Mallory Rule.","start":711.931,"stop":736.726,"duration":24.79},{"text":"And without attempting to be fictitious, I respectfully suggest that the time has come to make a profit out of the Supreme of Florida because the McNabb-Mallory Rule is an essential part of due process.","start":736.726,"stop":748.675,"duration":11.95},{"text":"In the McNabb case, Mr. Justice Frankfurter and I won't repeat it but he makes an eloquent exposition as to the rational of that case, the public policy behind the rule.","start":748.675,"stop":759.499,"duration":10.82},{"text":"Certainly, due process requires that the police must with reasonable profits, show legal cause for detaining an arrested person.","start":759.499,"stop":766.745,"duration":7.25},{"text":"And if this is an important safeguard not only to convict form the innocent but towards actually convicting the guilty in an enlightened society.","start":766.745,"stop":775.331,"duration":8.59},{"text":"This rational of this case applies certainly to state court proceedings.","start":775.331,"stop":780.721,"duration":5.39},{"text":"I think it's also interesting that in both McNabb and Mallory decisions, this Court did not reject the constitutional

Honor.","start":885.493,"stop":889.305,"duration":3.81},{"text":"Now, I think as this Court knows, the purpose of a preliminary hearing is to weed out groundless or unsupported charge of grave
