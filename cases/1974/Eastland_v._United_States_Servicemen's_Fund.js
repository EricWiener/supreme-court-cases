careful and thoughtful consideration to the requirements of the coordinate branch of government, namely the Congress of the United States to participate in their legislative proceeding without fear -- without fear of either intimidation by the executive or being called before as the case would say a potentially hostile judiciary.","start":584.457,"stop":619.935,"duration":35.48},{"text":"And they have gone further.","start":619.935,"stop":621.572,"duration":1.64},{"text":"The cases have gone further and say -- and in addition to that, members of Congress should not be burdened with the difficulty of defending suits which are brought against them for acts performed in the legislatives sphere.","start":621.572,"stop":641.08,"duration":19.51},{"text":"Thus, we already have the fact that voting, committee reports, authorizing committee investigations and receiving materials pursuant thereto, introducing material at committee hearing, referring the committee reports to the speaker.","start":641.08,"stop":662.777,"duration":21.7},{"text":"Distributing and using reports for legislative purposes are all within the legislative sphere and immune from any kind of action under the speech and debate clause.","start":662.777,"stop":676.893,"duration":14.12},{"text":"Furthermore, if we prescient from Doe versus McMillan and the Gravel case, and go back to the case of Dombrowski versus Eastland and examine what was held there in the Court of Appeals and in fact in the Supreme Court of the United States and we will find that the allegation in that case was that the defendants tortuously conspired to subpoena records in an illegal manner from a Louisiana and American activity committee who had records belonging to the plaintiffs in that case.","start":676.893,"stop":716.959,"duration":40.07},{"text":"The Court of Appeals gladly held that the action pursuant to that subpoena insofar as the Senator and the General Counsel of the Committee were concerned were absolutely and totally immune.","start":716.959,"stop":734.42,"duration":17.46},{"text":"The Court of Appeals affirmed -- I mean the Supreme Court affirmed that part of the decision which dealt with the Senator pointing out that there was no evidence in the record to connect him with any of the activities with the exception of the authorization of the subpoena and authorizing its service.","start":734.42,"stop":757.475,"duration":23.06},{"text":"That case is a flat holding that the conduct here is not subject to review but is totally immune under the speech and debate clause.","start":757.475,"stop":772.998,"duration":15.52},{"text":"The other factor which can be drawn from decisions of this Court, the Doe case and Gravel is that even unconstitutional conduct by members of the Congress and reading those cases, their aide, if within the legislative sphere are not subject to review by this Court or any other form, that is the holding of those cases.","start":772.998,"stop":804.381,"duration":31.38},{"text":"Furthermore, presenting from the speech or debate clause and going to the basis of the coordinate branch of government theory namely separation of powers, the doctrine which was discussed in the Doe case along with the speech and debate clause and within the Gravel case points out that the judiciary where there is an immunity such as it exist under the facts of this case may not interfere with the action of Congress.","start":804.381,"stop":837.203,"duration":32.82},{"text":"On this, I should emphasize as this Court did in McGrain versus Daugherty that the absolute necessity for an informed Congress is the ability to subpoena individuals and subpoena documents and that any inhibition on that power is in fact an inhibition on the ability to legislate wisely.","start":837.203,"stop":869.474,"duration":32.27},{"text":"The Court of Appeals pointed out that the document subpoenaed in this case were bank records and that the evidence that was adduced before the District Court, District Court Judge Gasch demonstrated that the -- what the really real concern of the respondents here were in fact loss of contributions.","start":869.474,"stop":896.132,"duration":26.66},{"text":"Thus we had testimony by professional fundraisers and by representatives of this organization, that there were anonymous contribution, there were contributions by cashier's check from brokerage accounts.","start":896.132,"stop":912.483,"duration":16.35},{"text":"There were contributions from corporations that were “fronts” from individuals and in fact there was one example and I don't know whether it was hypothetical or not where the individual testified that the real anonymity was achieved where you had lunch with the donor and took cash at the lunch table.","start":912.483,"stop":935.374,"duration":22.89},{"text":"These were the types of anonymous contributions which the respondents apparently felt would be disclosed should the bank records be made public.","start":935.374,"stop":947.41,"duration":12.04},{"text":"Although I hasten to add the record does not show what the bank records in fact contained with respect to the names of contributors or not.","start":947.41,"stop":957.397,"duration":9.99},{"text":"This brings us to a very interesting part of this case because here we have an attempt to equate the raising of funds, the contributing of money by a non-profit, tax exempt by a ruling organization and as distinguished from any showing that the membership of that organization is connected with or tied to contributions.","start":957.397,"stop":986.901,"duration":29.5},{"text":"Now, the argument has been made and I must emphasize to the Court in the brief filed by respondents, they say that page 41, 42 or 43 that the speech or debate clause was not mentioned by the government who represented the respondents before the Court of Appeal.","start":986.901,"stop":1008.58,"duration":21.68},{"text":"And I think if you will look at the brief that was filed on behalf of these respondents in the Court of Appeals, there is a long and extensive section on the speech and debate clause citing Dombrowski, Doe v. McMillan and all of the other cases.","start":1008.58,"stop":1022.125,"duration":13.54},{"text":"I would not want the Court to think that this issue was one just raised before this Court because it had been raised in the trial court and in fact before this Court.","start":1022.125,"stop":1031.635,"duration":9.51},{"text":"But we are now in a position where what the respondents are arguing and have argued is that bank records which show potentially the source of contributors if they not be in cash is something which is covered by the First Amendment, freedom of association and I submit to the court that nowhere has this Court or to my knowledge any other court gone so far.","start":1031.635,"stop":1064.46,"duration":32.83},{"text":"If in fact records of a bank which deal with moneys received by an organization, whether it be the United States Servicemen's Fund or perhaps the Republican or the Democratic Party.","start":1064.46,"stop":1079.337,"duration":14.88}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
