Frey","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.","start":7.495,"stop":10.712,"duration":3.22},{"text":"This case is here on the government's petition for writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, dismissing the government's appeal from the judgment of the District Court in this case which after a jury verdict of guilty, dismissed respondent's indictment because of allegedly prejudicial pre-indictment delay.","start":10.712,"stop":34.28,"duration":23.57},{"text":"Respondent was the Financial Secretary and the Business Manager of a union local in Pennsylvania.","start":34.28,"stop":39.58,"duration":5.3},{"text":"The indictment charged that he had converted approximately $1,200 in funds belonging to the union, for the purpose of paying the cost of his daughter's wedding reception in 1966.","start":39.58,"stop":50.894,"duration":11.31},{"text":"This payment was made by a check issued by two officers of the union, Brinker and Schaefer.","start":50.894,"stop":56.722,"duration":5.83},{"text":"Brinker died in 1968 before the investigation of respondent's activities by the FBI was very far along.","start":56.722,"stop":67.1,"duration":10.38},{"text":"By the time the indictment was returned in this case, in 1971, Schaefer was terminally ill and he was unavailable to testify at respondent's trial.","start":67.1,"stop":80.477,"duration":13.38},{"text":"On the basis of the unavailability of Mr. Schaefer and Brinker, respondent twice moved before trial for dismissal of the charges against him.","start":80.477,"stop":89.882,"duration":9.41},{"text":"Hearings were held on both these motions and the evidence on behalf of the government at these hearings showed that Schaefer and Brinker had no active role in the union's business affairs, that their signatures on the union checks were a routine perfunctory matter.","start":89.882,"stop":104.71,"duration":14.83},{"text":"Respondent on the other hand testified that he had never directed anyone to prepare the check or to use union funds to pay for his daughter's wedding.","start":104.71,"stop":113.53,"duration":8.82},{"text":"After each hearing, the District Court denied respondent's motion to dismiss.","start":113.53,"stop":118.316,"duration":4.79},{"text":"At trial, respondent moved for a judgment of acquittal, which was denied and the case was submitted to the jury which returned a guilty verdict.","start":118.316,"stop":127.16,"duration":8.84},{"text":"Respondent then renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal, it was again denied.","start":127.16,"stop":132.13,"duration":4.97},{"text":"Thereafter, respondent filed further post trial motions again asking for acquittal and also for arrest of judgment on new trial.","start":132.13,"stop":139.211,"duration":7.08},{"text":"Each motion was based in part on his contention regarding the pre-indictment delay.","start":139.211,"stop":144.658,"duration":5.45},{"text":"Three weeks after the filing of these motions, the District Court entered an order dismissing the indictment on the grounds of prejudicial pre-indictment delay.","start":144.658,"stop":152.733,"duration":8.08},{"text":"It did so without eluding to its previous actions denying the same motions prior to trial, but stating that it had taken notice of facts brought out in the testimony of the case concerning the potential testimony of Mr. Schaefer.","start":152.733,"stop":166.42,"duration":13.69},{"text":"Since we believe that the District Court had erred in its legal conclusion, that there was an unreasonable delay depriving respondent of his opportunity for a fair trial, and that this was in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, an appeal to the Third Circuit was authorized.","start":166.42,"stop":183.561,"duration":17.14},{"text":"The Court of Appeals initially entered an order dismissing the appeal in citing Sisson and claiming that the appeal was not permissible under the statute.","start":183.561,"stop":193.622,"duration":10.06},{"text":"Consequently, we filed a petition for re-hearing and also in the event there was some statutory problem in their view, a petition for mandamus in the alternative relying on the Dooling case in the Second Circuit.","start":193.622,"stop":208.603,"duration":14.98},{"text":"Re-hearing was denied and this time the Court of Appeals issued an opinion.","start":208.603,"stop":212.99,"duration":4.39},{"text":"It agreed that there was no statutory impediment to appeal, leaving aside of course, the statutes in corporation of any constitutional restrictions.","start":212.99,"stop":221.314,"duration":8.32},{"text":"They concluded that the appeal was constitutionally barred because the action of the Trial Court was an acquittal and because acquittals could not in its view be appealed consistently with the Double Jeopardy Clause.","start":221.314,"stop":232.739,"duration":11.43},{"text":"In concluding that the action of the District Court was an acquittal, the Court of Appeals relied on the definition of the term in Sission, where by the way, it was being defined for the purpose of determining a question of appealability under former Section 3731.","start":232.739,"stop":247.996,"duration":15.26},{"text":"That definition is, “the trial judge's disposition is an acquittal, if it is a legal determination on the basis of facts adduced at trial relating to the general issue of the case.","start":247.996,"stop":260.151,"duration":12.16},{"text":"The Court of Appeal said that the determination made by the District Court here was based on the facts adduced at trial which we don't dispute and that these facts related to the general issue of the case.","start":260.151,"stop":275.503,"duration":15.35},{"text":"And that therefore, since it was based on facts adduced at trial which related to the general issue of the case, it was an acquittal, even though the determination itself had nothing to do with the general issue of the case.","start":275.503,"stop":289.115,"duration":13.61},{"text":"Now, the case poses two questions, one which we began discussing this morning in the Jenkins case, that is assuming that this is characterized as an acquittal properly by the Court of Appeals, does that bar our recourse to appellate review, and secondly the question of whether -- if that is the case, was it properly so characterized.","start":289.115,"stop":315.158,"duration":26.04},{"text":"Now, I'd like to deal further with the first issue if I may, which we were discussing this morning.","start":315.158,"stop":324.418,"duration":9.26},{"text":"I think the Court has to look at this question which as I've indicated is a matter of first impression here.","start":324.418,"stop":334.359,"duration":9.94},{"text":"And it has to consider of what it is that the government is asking to have done, and what the interests are of the system of public justice on the one hand, and the legitimate interest of the defendant that the Constitution recognizes and seeks to protect on the other hand.","start":334.359,"stop":353.059,"duration":18.7},{"text":"Now, we submit that there is no articulable value, there is no rational constitutional policy, that is dis-served by allowing government appeals in circumstances such as those presented by this case.","start":353.059,"stop":366.349,"duration":13.29},{"text":"If the government appeal fails, that is if we're wrong on the merits and the District Court was right, then the judgment is affirmed and the defendant is finally discharged and the matter is concluded.","start":366.349,"stop":379.872,"duration":13.52},{"text":"On the other hand if it succeeds, the trial court is simply required to attach to the trial that has already taken place, the correct legal consequences.","start":379.872,"stop":390.084,"duration":10.21},{"text":"Now -- but none of the values which the Double Jeopardy Clause is designed to serve are impaired by our
