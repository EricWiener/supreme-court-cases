don't think the fact that the Commission limited the divestiture to Armour could be fairly viewed as any indication that it concluded that the rest of the acquisitions were not illegal, this was a consent order, and this was a settlement.","start":269.657,"stop":284.078,"duration":14.42},{"text":"They agreed to give up the major acquisition they've made in return for which the Commission allowed them to keep some of the others and that they both agreed to include this ten-year ban on further acquisitions.","start":284.078,"stop":296.912,"duration":12.83},{"text":"Now that provision is set out at pages 88–89 of the record, and what it says, directed the respondent to cease and desist for ten years without the prior approval of the Commission from acquiring directly or indirectly,

of the sale of bread and bread-type rolls.","start":296.912,"stop":328.117,"duration":31.21},{"text":"Now, as I've indicated, the agreement which the party signed consenting to this order stated two things.","start":328.117,"stop":337.897,"duration":9.78},{"text":"First, it stated that in construing this order, any of the parties could properly, the Commission and the parties could properly refer to the complaint itself.","start":337.897,"stop":348.815,"duration":10.92},{"text":"And in two provisions of the complaint, that we think are significant in determining the purpose of this ban on acquisitions for ten years without prior Commission approval.","start":348.815,"stop":360.467,"duration":11.65},{"text":"One of the allegations was, that as result of these acquisitions Continental had eliminated these acquired bakeries as independent competitive factors.","start":360.467,"stop":373.078,"duration":12.61},{"text":"The other thing that the complaint referred to, was there was a substantial trend to industry wide concentration in the baking business.","start":373.078,"stop":383.175,"duration":10.1},{"text":"These two allegations are set forth at pages 67-68 of the appendix.","start":383.175,"stop":389.938,"duration":6.76},{"text":"Now, in addition there were certain things stated in the appendix which was made a part of the agreement on the consent order, which bore on what the Commission was thinking when it approved this order.","start":389.938,"stop":403.791,"duration":13.85},{"text":"The reason for that is the parties stipulated, that these were factors that the Commission could consider in determining whether it would be the public interest to adopt this consent order.","start":403.791,"stop":416.108,"duration":12.32},{"text":"And at pages -- page 84, which is the end of the appendix, I would like to read just two sentences at the -- just before the first full paragraph.","start":416.108,"stop":428.359,"duration":12.25},{"text":"The parties said that, if this order is adopted by the Commission, the respondent's alleged continuous practice of acquiring companies baking and selling bread and bread-type rolls will be brought to a halt and the major acquisition forming the gravamen of the complaint will be undone.","start":428.359,"stop":449.051,"duration":20.69},{"text":"Competition may be restored essentially as it existed before the accusation of Armour Inc. and the public interest will be well served.","start":449.051,"stop":458.39,"duration":9.34},{"text":"Now, it seems to us that rather clearly, what the parties intended this order to do is two things.","start":458.39,"stop":464.619,"duration":6.23},{"text":"One, to bring to a halt the alleged practice of Continental of increasing concentration by acquiring one bakery after another and secondly, to undo one of the principal adverse effects on competition resulting from these acquisitions by requiring divestiture of the major accusation, the Armour bakeries.","start":464.619,"stop":486.903,"duration":22.28},{"text":"This order was approved by the Commission in May, of 1962, and in 1966 the Commission undertook an investigation to determine whether certain conduct by Continental violated the order.","start":486.903,"stop":501.863,"duration":14.96},{"text":"Specifically, it looked into three transactions which formed the violations involved in this case.","start":501.863,"stop":508.423,"duration":6.56},{"text":"The transactions are substantially similar.","start":508.423,"stop":510.662,"duration":2.24},{"text":"In each case, there was an independent bakery which previously had both produced bread and roll, and distributed it and in each case the independent bakery agreed in effect with Continental, that it would give up its production of the bakery products, and would instead distribute to its previous existing customers, the products that were made by Continental.","start":510.662,"stop":536.152,"duration":25.49},{"text":"In other words Continental in effect, took over, took over the routes and provided the bread for these customers that had previously been the property of the independent customers.","start":536.152,"stop":553.921,"duration":17.77},{"text":"The stipulated facts in this case, on the basis of which the district court decided it, are that the independent bakery distributed these products of Continental exclusively under Continental's name over the routes and to the same customers that it had hitherto distributed its own product.","start":553.921,"stop":580.052,"duration":26.13},{"text":"And since -- there's a question here as to what, whether this was an acquisition of assets, I think it's not insignificant that each of the written agreements under which Continental took this over, are captioned sales agreement.","start":580.052,"stop":593.773,"duration":13.72},{"text":"After investigation of these, nine of these transactions, in 1968 the Federal Trade Commission certified the case in accordance with the statute to the Attorney General asking that penalties be sort for these three violations of the order.","start":593.773,"stop":611.132,"duration":17.36},{"text":"In the interim, and the complaint was filed in December 1968, in the interim in September 1968, Continental Baking was acquired by the present respondent ITT Continental, a wholly on subsidy area of International Telephone and Telegraph.","start":611.132,"stop":629.441,"duration":18.31},{"text":"The government's theory upon which it sought these penalties, was that these transactions violated the ban and the order against acquiring directly or indirectly the whole or any part of the assets of a bakery firm.","start":629.441,"stop":645.911,"duration":16.47},{"text":"The District Court held that two of the violations violated the order but that the third one didn't.","start":645.911,"stop":652.418,"duration":6.51},{"text":"The Court of Appeals affirmed the findings of two violations but disagreed with the court of -- with the District Court as to the third and held that all three of them violated the order.","start":652.418,"stop":663.063,"duration":10.64},{"text":"I think the rationale of these holdings is well set forth in the District Court's finding that it said, this is at page 14 (A) of the appendix to our petition.","start":663.063,"stop":675.561,"duration":12.5},{"text":"It said particularly in businesses where route salesman are involved, customer lists have a peculiar value and that they frequently represent the principal asset of a business.","start":675.561,"stop":685.767,"duration":10.21},{"text":"And it said that in connection with these transactions, the most important assets that Continental acquired were the sales routes and sales volume and in reversing the one transaction that the District Court had held did not violate the order, the court.","start":685.767,"stop":701.389,"duration":15.62},{"text":"Court of Appeals said that the market, that is the customers and the volume, the business of distributing the bread was acquired and this was a principle asset of the bakery.","start":701.389,"stop":715.737,"duration":14.35},{"text":"This determination reflected one of the facts stipulated in the District Court which is at page 31 of the appendix that route books and customer lists are asset of any person, firm or corporation engaged in the distribution and sale of bakery products.","start":715.737,"stop":733.456,"duration":17.72},{"text":"The complaint in this case sought penalties of $1,000 a day for each of these three acquisitions, for each day that they held them from the time of the acquisitions and the transactions until the filing of the complaint.","start":733.456,"stop":751.588,"duration":18.13},{"text":"The District Court rejected this claim ruling that this was not a continuing violation within the meaning of the penalty provision, but was merely a single violation and necessed a penalty for each of the two violations, the maximum statutory penalty of $5,000.","start":751.588,"stop":770.286,"duration":18.7},{"text":"What the court said is that the order prescribes only the active acquisition not any retention and it said once these two acquisitions were accomplished, the violations were completed.","start":770.286,"stop":783.532,"duration":13.25},{"text":"And the Court of Appeals of the Tenth Circuit confirmed that holding saying that the -- once again the order does not bar the retention of assets illegally acquired but only the acquisition itself.","start":783.532,"stop":796.443,"duration":12.91},{"text":"Now subsequent to
