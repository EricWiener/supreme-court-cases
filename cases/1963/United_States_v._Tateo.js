Southern District of New York, dismissing an indictment for bank robbery on the ground that a trial of defendant there under would subject him to double

under a five-count indictment arising out of the robbery of a bank in Port Chester, New York.","start":51.037,"stop":64.684,"duration":13.65},{"text":"One of the counts, count three, charged

penalty.","start":64.684,"stop":83.456,"duration":18.77},{"text":"After four days of trial in which the codefendant testified and implicated the defendant, he came in on a Monday morning and with counsel present said he had decided to plea guilty.","start":83.456,"stop":96.63,"duration":13.17},{"text":"Now, those proceedings are in the record at pages 69, and on the surface they seem perfectly proper, defendant said he was acting voluntarily, he was represented by counsel, and he even went so far as to consent to a search having disclosed where the money, part of the money from the robbery was hidden.","start":96.63,"stop":119.836,"duration":23.21},{"text":"However, some years later, the defendant attacked his plea of guilty by a motion under 28 U.S.C.

years.","start":131.418,"stop":157.768,"duration":26.35},{"text":"Now that was the sentence which he attacked some years later and his motion under 2255 came before Judge Weinfeld for hearing in

the life sentence on the kidnapping charge and then I am going to add consecutive maximum sentences on the other counts on which they are found guilty.","start":185.352,"stop":221.138,"duration":35.79},{"text":"Judge Weinfeld found that this has a coercive effect, particularly coercive in a sense because the government's case was very strong

say okay, we'll start all over again.","start":249.179,"stop":253.691,"duration":4.51},{"text":"And so they moved not only for a retrial on the counts to which the defendant had pleaded guilty, hey

made a motion to have it dismissed on the grounds that a trail they are under would constitute double jeopardy.","start":274.008,"stop":286.036,"duration":12.03},{"text":"And it was at the suggestion of the district Judge, Judge Tyler that the motion was broadened to include both a motion to dismiss the kidnapping count and a motion to dismiss the four counts on which the defendant had pleaded
