Kumar, and no exposition on my part will improve on what I regard as the pinnacle of insight about the correct application of the... the Second Circuit simply held that a double standard notice designed to contain prejudice and become a rule of thumb for assessing prejudice, that a double standard of notice not only is anomalous but inherently incompatible with the fair administration of a rule of this Court for which the intention need not be sought in other publications but for which the Court has only to look into it, as this Court carries the responsibility for the consequences of how its rules work in practice, i.e. by the standard of whether the merits can be addressed and fulfilled or whether they're blocked out by some error which the Court has the means to correct.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In my view there are five strong reasons why the Court below should be reversed.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"First, that as applied in the Third Circuit as compared with the second, it achieves a double standard of notice for which there is no laches, no reason of police.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"As a matter of fact Judge Sykes in this very case said, in point of policy our view, the view for which I contend this morning, is, quote, 15-C.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Now, it is some commentary on a rule of law that a judge squirms visibly in the process of applying it and that's quite true about every application of the point of view which the Third Circuit adopted in this case because asked for its comment on it, the most that they could say is the rule is too plain not to read literally, but no policy, no other reason or justification for that result whereas those who favor the point of view for which I argue, among courts, have this to say, that they find it appealing, a member of this Court said that, that as a policy matter it's quite persuasive, that was Judge Sykes, that the other point of view is anomalous, Judge Feinberg, that the construction for which I contend is permissible and desirable, again judge Feinburg.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The Sixth Circuit, they were stronger.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"They said about the other rule that it was narrow, formalistic, and Professor Rise capped it all by saying it was niggly.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In any case, an outcome, not to be rested on adjectives or adverbs, but it said something when in point of policy every court which comments on it says the right road is this direction and somehow I am compelled to take the other one.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Well, I submit that that is not a penultimate compulsion for as this Court wrote the rule, it can read the rule and the reading of the rule can match its purpose and its purpose at least was unmistakeable in 1966.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"There are... there is another reason.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Justice Stevens by his question noted that this case belongs with misnomers.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Now, there is no state system of procedure I know that is today so primitive that it would labor, much less gag, over the correction of misnomer.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Now, I think there's something more than anomalous if in 1986 in this Court a standard application, correction of misnomer as distinguished from other party changes is when measured by procedural developments throughout the country, regressive.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And yet that's what it would be, at least by comparison.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"I have already said that in my outlook any rule, any rule in this this book which applies in such a way as to blemish, deform, much less screen out the merits over procedural errors which are correctable without prejudice--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Schnitzer, one of the purposes of the rules is to require thing to be done in a particular period of time.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"You have to have some time limits.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Morris M.
