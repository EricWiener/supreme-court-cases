Heft, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"No, Your Honor, but I think that is a factor that the jury can use to determine the credibility.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"When the circumstances are viewed, the petitioner being a 16-year-old boy operating at the level of a third or fourth grade child, is put in this small room with several police officers, that bears on the reliability of what the defendant or petitioner states to those police officers in the course of that interrogation.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And that why the room is... I think the size of the room is so significant.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The Kentucky Supreme Court based its decision on several justifications, one of which included perceived difficulty in separating evidence of the confession's voluntariness and evidence of its credibility.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The Kentucky court reasoned that the separation function is better vested in the trial judge than in the hands of the jury.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"That conclusion, however, is based on a misperception of this Court's ruling in both Jackson and Lego.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"This Court acknowledged in those cases that there is in fact difficulty in separating evidence of a confession's voluntariness from evidence of its credibility, but neither case expressed any doubt that the jury was fully capable of properly using evidence for the purpose of determining a confession's credibility and weight simply because evidence about the circumstances under which the confession was obtained is introduced.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Neither did the Court express any doubt that the jury could not properly discharge its factfinding function merely because of the difficulty in separating the evidence of a confession's voluntariness and evidence of its guilt.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Indeed, the confidence that the jury can properly use evidence is, I think, a matter of common experience, and it is perhaps best reflected in the multiple admissibility rules, which when applied to this case would hold that evidence of a confession's credibility is not inadmissible simply because it is also evidence of a confession's voluntariness.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"As we indicated in the appendices to our brief, every jurisdiction with the exception of Kentucky that has ruled on this matter allows a jury to determine and hear evidence about the circumstances under which the confession is obtained for the purpose of determining either the confession's credibility, its voluntariness, or both.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The second justification offered by the Kentucky Supreme Court for its rule was that the defendant offers very selective evidence when he doesn't testify in cases in which his confession is admitted as evidence against him.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The court was concerned that the jury would not be made aware of the defendant's prior experience with the law, his familiarity with interrogating procedures, and his familiarity with his Miranda rights.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Consequently, the Kentucky court reasoned that exclusion of such evidence would allow the defense to paint an unfair picture for the jury.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"That perceived danger, however, is unlikely to exist in any case because if the defendant were able to raise improper inferences from the evidence or raise or submit improper evidence.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The prosecution surely could object and refute that evidence by making specific objections, asking for admonitions, or even introducing rebuttal evidence.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The justifications for which the Kentucky Supreme Court based its ruling herein do not justify the abridgment of the constitutional rights of the petitioner in this instance.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Moreover, I think it is important to note that the state here was allowed to do precisely what the defendant was not allowed to do, and that is to introduce evidence about the circumstances under which the confession was procured.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The state introduced evidence that on two occasions prior to giving a statement petitioner was fully advised of his Miranda rights.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"He was explained those rights in detail and understood those rights.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Moreover, the state was allowed to introduce evidence that during the course of the interrogation procedure the petitioner was supplied with soft drinks and refreshments by the police officers.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Now, obviously, the purpose in introducing such evidence is to demonstrate that petitioner was well treated during the course of the confession, and thus the confession is credible, reliable, and trustworthy.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Surely if the prosecution can introduce evidence about the circumstances under which a confession is given to demonstrate its credibility, the same opportunity cannot be denied the defense where, as here, his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights at stake.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The determination of the Kentucky Supreme Court in its ruling here undermines the historical and the constitutional role of the jury to assess and determine the credibility and reliability of evidence in deciding the ultimate question of guilt and innocence.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The findings here of the trial judge were deemed conclusive, and the jury could not consider any evidence about the circumstances surrounding procurement of the confession, because he had already used that evidence in determining the confession's constitutional voluntariness.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"It is important here to realize that the confession's constitutional voluntariness is made without regard to its truth or its falsity, and therefore it is imperative that the jury be advised in full detail about all the evidence under which the circumstances of the confession were procured because they must... the judge doesn't decide the issue of credibility.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The issue must therefore be decided by the jury.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Since involuntary confessions can, of course, be untrue, it follows that as part of the right to present a defense, defendant must be able to fully and effectively cross examine and confront the police officers who participated in the course of the interrogation in order that the jury can assess the effect of the circumstances on the voluntariness of the confession.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"We would submit here that the Kentucky Supreme Court violated the petitioner's right to present a defense and his right to cross examination, and that the rule created by Kentucky is not only an artificial distinction it sought to draw, but it is premised on a fundamental misunderstanding of the effect of the role that the trial judge plays in the suppression hearing.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Consequently, the rule enacted by Kentucky results in an impermissible interference in the petitioner's right to present a defense, and we would urge the Court to reverse the decision and remand the case for a new trial.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Thank you.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.
