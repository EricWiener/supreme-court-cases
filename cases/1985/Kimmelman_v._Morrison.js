Powell by phrasing their claim in Sixth Amendment terms rather than Fourth Amendment terms does violence to the reasoning behind that opinion, and will eliminate the benefits of finality and comity which that opinion was intended to enhance.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Stone v. Powell is based on the premise that deterrence is the reason for the exclusionary rule, and that if states provide an opportunity to litigate Fourth Amendment claims in the state courts, the deterrent potential of the exclusionary rule will be fully realized.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The exclusionary rule, of course, is not intended to provide a personal benefit to criminal defendants, but to discourage police misconduct.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Therefore, defendants whose suppression motions are denied cannot claim that they have been denied a personal right, but only that society has not received whatever deterrent effect suppression in their case might have cost.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"This Court found in Stone versus Powell that the incremental benefits of applying Fourth Amendment law and exclusionary rule law on habeas corpus would be small.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Thus a defendant who claims that he was denied suppression due to the ineffective assistance of counsel can really only claim that society has been denied certain minor benefits which they might have received had the counsel acted differently.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"He still stands convicted on the basis of highly reliable evidence, and as in this case, rarely is evidence which is found to have been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment found to be unreliable, and there will be very little chance of an unjust conviction.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Claims of this type are really Fourth Amendment claims even though raised under the Sixth Amendment, and should be treated as such.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Defendant should no more be allowed to raise Fourth Amendment claims under the Sixth Amendment than they are under the Fourth Amendment.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"We suggest that this is particularly true in cases such as this in which the attorney error, if any, amounts to a procedural default of a reasonable state rule.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In other situations, attorney error or miscalculation concerning the law or the facts does not constitute cause under the first crime of Wainwright v. Sykes.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In a number of cases, including Reed v. Ross, this Court has noted that the criminal trial process is extremely complex, and if the system is to run efficiently so that just results can be reached in criminal trials, it is necessary that the states enact and enforce a series of rules and procedures.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Of course, if these rules are violated, it will nearly always be an attorney who is responsible for the violation.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"He is the one who makes the objections.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"He is the one who makes motions in cases.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"He will almost always be responsible.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"If a criminal defendant is allowed to excuse the violation of a procedure or a rule simply by claiming that the attorney has made the error, or attorney responsibility, there will be no way to enforce the rules since on habeas corpus a defendant who makes that type of claim in state court and does not prevail because the state court holds its own rules, will be able to claim a due process violation, and in doing so, if successful, will be able to effectively enforce noncompliance with the court rules.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"If this were allowed, we believe that the court rules would become meaningless because there would really be no way to enforce them in a meaningful way.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Nodes, there was an admitted violation here, wasn't there?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Allan J.

Sykes and such as Engle v. Isaac.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In Engle v.
