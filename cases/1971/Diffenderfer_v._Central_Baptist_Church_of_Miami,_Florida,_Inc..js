that to the extent that the statute prorates the taxability to that extent, it is constitutional.","start":404.176,"stop":417.487,"duration":13.31},{"text":"Now the question presented to this Court is whether this Court’s decision on Walz which upheld the exemptibility of property owned by a church and used exclusively for religious purposes extends to property which is used for in least , in part, purely in the secular field of commercial competition enterprise.","start":417.487,"stop":442.071,"duration":24.58},{"text":"The sole relationship to the church being that all of the profits of it go

specifically not before the Court then.","start":448.283,"stop":460.737,"duration":12.45},{"text":"In Walz the Court recognized and rejected the argument there presented that tax exemption represented the first step inevitable progression, the Court said, the history of tax exemption for 200 years shows there has not been an inevitable progression in breaking down the wall of separation between church and State.","start":460.737,"stop":485.39,"duration":24.65},{"text":"If your Honor please, this case shows that perhaps the Court was a little too optimistic in Walz because this is a further step.","start":485.39,"stop":493.917,"duration":8.53},{"text":"Unlike the Walz situation, this does not have the support of 200 years of uniform universal practice about which the Court both in the Court’s opinion and Congress' opinion relied large measure in Walz.","start":493.917,"stop":510.601,"duration":16.68},{"text":"It showed that ever since our constitution was written, in every state, the union including the Federal Government, land used exclusively for religious purposes was exempt and the Court pointed out and this Congress' opinion pointed out, as the Holmes statement, that this history is worth volumes of logic and should be great width.","start":510.601,"stop":533.099,"duration":22.5},{"text":"The history here is just the reverse.","start":533.099,"stop":535.368,"duration":2.27},{"text":"The history here shows, and I pointed out in our brief, that even as far back as 1217, there was this device of turning all the property to a religiously owned property for non-religious use as a means of avoiding the obligations of feudalism and what today would be the functional equivalent of taxation.","start":535.368,"stop":557.525,"duration":22.16},{"text":"Now, it is our contention that a statute which exempts a church from those burdens which every secular commercial institution bears in its operation, the commercial area is inevitably a statute whose purpose or certainly its effect, whatever its purpose, its primary effect is the advancement of religion.","start":557.525,"stop":586.577,"duration":29.05},{"text":"To that extent it is subject to the restrictions of the First Amendment.","start":586.577,"stop":593.254,"duration":6.68},{"text":"Now in Walz, the Court noted aside from the historical background of tax exemption that the distinctive state would be an alternative though, taxed the church in which case, there will have to be some entanglement of the state and church affairs or do not tax it in which case the entanglement if any will be considerably less.","start":593.254,"stop":623.163,"duration":29.91},{"text":"And the rationale of the Court, as I see is, if you ask my opinions as I see is this, that prima facie at the very least, a statute by the State which advances religion or aids religion is prima facie subject to constitutional, at least scrutiny, strong scrutiny, and it is only if you can show as was, certain in Walz that there was a countervailing factor that to tax would impose another evil which the First Amendment was sought to avoid, the evil of entanglement, then we will allow the exemption rather than invoke the entanglement.","start":623.163,"stop":665.319,"duration":42.16},{"text":"Now in the case that is decided since we wrote the brief in this case, the Lemon, and DiCenso, and Tilton cases, the Court molded that the Walz case did not intend and it did not expand the scope of governmental, of permissible governmental aids religion but restricted it.","start":665.319,"stop":686.168,"duration":20.85},{"text":"And the Court noted, particularly in Tilton which involved the collegiate and the Court held that that part of the federal law which said that after 20 years, a college which receives support funds to build a facility may use it for any purpose.","start":686.168,"stop":706.755,"duration":20.59},{"text":"That part of it the Court unanimously, there was no Court’s opinion in Tilton that was (Inaudible)","start":706.755,"stop":711.967,"duration":5.21},{"text":"But all my Justices agreed that to that extent at least that statute was unconstitutional, there was some value which existed after 20 years and the State could not or the Federal Government could not aid or advance religion to that extent.","start":711.967,"stop":730.689,"duration":18.72},{"text":"Even though it would mean continuing surveillance and entanglement after 20 years because the statute, the (Inaudible) forbids the use of those facilities and federal funds to be for sectarian teaching or religious worship.","start":730.689,"stop":752.794,"duration":22.11},{"text":"So that the government agents after 20 years would still have to keep an eye on that facility to make sure it was not used for religion.","start":752.794,"stop":762.049,"duration":9.25},{"text":"Thus quite clearly indicating although there seems to be an impression which I do not believe is valid that the Eversen rule has been buried that government may aid religion, I do not know if any case would so hold but it is quite clear that Tilton and Lemon, DiCenso do not allow a government aid to religion absent of some countervailing factor such as in Walz entanglement in Everson, the welfare of children were protected from the accidents -- of the hazards of the roads and that type of case.","start":762.049,"stop":798.142,"duration":36.09},{"text":"Now, and our contention here is that the amount of entanglement involved in financing the commercial activities of a religious group is minimum and that it is far outweighed by the other factors which call for constitutional restriction upon that aid or benefit to religion.","start":798.142,"stop":823.939,"duration":25.8},{"text":"One of the things which we believe should be considered by the Court which the Court noted both in Walz and in Lemon and DiCenso, that one of the things, one of the major evils, the First Amendment was aimed at -- of wordings, was that the Court “the potential for political divisiveness along religious or divisive political potential that the fathers of the First Amendment were afraid and they had a whole history of 2,000 years of political confidence and decisiveness, because of religion that a church is seeking certain benefits and the church in return is seeking to control the statement and trying to control the church.","start":823.939,"stop":873.235,"duration":49.3},{"text":"We contend that this type of legislation which puts a competitive advantage in the business world in favor of churches necessarily bring to that type of divisive political potential which this Court wanted to get both in Walz and repeated it Lemon against DiCenso.","start":873.235,"stop":898.799,"duration":25.56},{"text":"The acrimony, the bitterness, the feelings of a grudge locks on there and across the street from downtown, that owned by the church, that the church does not have to pay a tax and therefore can undercut it whereas he has to pay a tax.","start":898.799,"stop":917.965,"duration":19.17},{"text":"That kind of political divisiveness, that kind of reaction towards a favoritism for the church is one of the dangers which I believe the First Amendment was intended to
