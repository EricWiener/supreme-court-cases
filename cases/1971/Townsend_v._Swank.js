needy.","start":650.729,"stop":656.097,"duration":5.37},{"text":"The states have ample opportunity to protect themselves from adverse fiscal impact under this Court’s decision in Rosado, allowing

minimal.","start":677.61,"stop":685.367,"duration":7.76},{"text":"It would be approximately $500,000.00 a year and the Federal Government would point, put up the $500,000.00 a year making a total of approximately $1 million.","start":685.367,"stop":697.463,"duration":12.1},{"text":"We would also like to point out to the Court that the state’s purpose of encouraging employability which the state

employability.","start":697.463,"stop":715.132,"duration":17.67},{"text":"But we will submit that rationale under this Court’s decision in Shapiro is not permissible or not logical.","start":715.132,"stop":721.667,"duration":6.54},{"text":"In Shapiro, the court said that, encouraging employability was no justification for imposing one year residency

in technical or vocational school, although, they are technically as needy as somebody who is in a college or university, those children are still less in need of number one because it is more likely

Report went on to say federal sharing for this purpose would thus be available to states who implement such a program, for payments to children regularly attending a college or university as well as
