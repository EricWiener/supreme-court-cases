it's products occurs in South Carolina when the shipping papers are endorsed over to the purchaser, the wholesaler distributor in South Carolina.","start":763.418,"stop":778.312,"duration":14.89},{"text":"Now again, we should take another look at the Federal statute.","start":778.312,"stop":782.501,"duration":4.19},{"text":"The Federal statute which I quote says, “No state shall impose a net income-tax on income derived from inter-state commerce.","start":782.501,"stop":791.192,"duration":8.69},{"text":"If the only business

commerce and if the shipments or deliveries are made from a point outside the state.","start":805.108,"stop":820.424,"duration":15.32},{"text":"It is difficult to conceive of a state of facts which is closer to the protection of the federal statute than this case.","start":820.424,"stop":830.042,"duration":9.62},{"text":"Heublein accepts it's goods, accepts these orders in Hartford.","start":830.042,"stop":834.044,"duration":4},{"text":"The inventory of Heublein is maintained outside of South Carolina, generally in Hartford.","start":834.044,"stop":841.524,"duration":7.48},{"text":"The goods are shipped from Connecticut in most cases directly to South Carolina.","start":841.524,"stop":847.211,"duration":5.69},{"text":"They are earmarked for a particular purchase order which has been approved and confirmed by the producer in Hartford.","start":847.211,"stop":857.298,"duration":10.09},{"text":"These transactions are clearly an inter-state commerce.","start":857.298,"stop":861.24,"duration":3.94},{"text":"However, the appellate, South Carolina claims the affirmation of it's highest court that the transfer of legal ownership has a technical title in South Carolina as required by it's own ABC Laws, is sufficient to change these inter-state transactions into intra-state transactions.","start":861.24,"stop":883.674,"duration":22.43},{"text":"The basis for this conclusion is that there is no shipment or delivery from out of state because the goods are still owned by the producer when they arrive in the state.","start":883.674,"stop":898.49,"duration":14.82},{"text":"It would hardly seem necessary to go beyond plain meaning of the Federal statute to reject this argument.","start":898.49,"stop":904.895,"duration":6.4},{"text":"However, there is, if there is any ambiguity in the Federal statute, it seems clearly to have been put to rest by the Senate Committee Report.","start":904.895,"stop":917.097,"duration":12.2},{"text":"The senate committee report rejected any state imposed point of sale tests in

helpful.","start":926.99,"stop":931.119,"duration":4.13},{"text":"This is Senate Committee Report number 658 from the 86th Congress, first session, “The committee understands that the formulas

manufactured, in the place where the goods were stored, in the place where the transaction was finally approved, in the place where the selling company was domiciled or in the place where the goods

sale under it's own tax laws.","start":965.075,"stop":999.179,"duration":34.1},{"text":"Each of several different states treat the same sale as attributable to it because of it's own definition of

attributed.","start":999.179,"stop":1016.149,"duration":16.97},{"text":"In other words, this is a clear rejection by Congress of any place of sale test, particularly where the place of sale is
