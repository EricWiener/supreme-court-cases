reasonable attempt of the representatives of the people of the State of Illinois to bring in our cake an unworkable tax structure, into accordance with the problems of our modern day society and bring a taxing system that was based in the time when Illinois was an agricultural State over hundred years ago in the line with the concepts of today when we were one of the largest industrial States in the nation.","start":25.173,"stop":71.733,"duration":46.56},{"text":"The tax under consideration was the Personal Property Tax which is unworkable, unjust and unfair to the people of our

funds came from the assessments and corporations that were easy to ascertain and easy to enforce due to the fact that we could dissolve the corporation if they failed to file their papers and to pay their taxes.","start":92.904,"stop":111.567,"duration":18.66},{"text":"The tax in individuals was administered variously throughout 102 different counties.","start":111.567,"stop":118.013,"duration":6.45},{"text":"One example of the discrepancy was that the downstate agricultural community, the individuals paid $27 million in 1970, and in the industrial areas of Chicago, it was less than $2 million.","start":118.013,"stop":133.193,"duration":15.18},{"text":"It was virtually impossible to ascertain the intangibles and then some of the means of assessing they took into consideration that to tax it at the full rate would be almost a confiscation of the property.","start":133.193,"stop":148.723,"duration":15.53},{"text":"For that reason, the legislature, the elected officials and the members of the delegation to the new constitutional convention all strived to develop an orderly way of phasing out this tax.","start":148.723,"stop":167.823,"duration":19.1},{"text":"Along with that proposition, the legislatures of the State in 1969 also voted to impose the State income tax in the State for the first time.","start":167.823,"stop":178.949,"duration":11.13},{"text":"That income tax was held constitutional by the Supreme Court of Illinois despite the fact that there was a difference in classification

individuals.","start":191.61,"stop":218.252,"duration":26.64},{"text":"That resolution was adopted overwhelmingly, somewhere between seven and eight out of every person in the State voted for

budgets of the local school districts and local governments had been determined accordingly.","start":231.372,"stop":267.824,"duration":36.45},{"text":"However, with the desire to completely phase out the Personal Property Tax by 1979, the delegates to the constitutional convention provided that any taxes that were eliminated on personal property after January 1, 1971, or in other words, the day

because of the amendment, but went on to rule that the amendment to the Constitution was unconstitutional under the Federal Constitution.","start":357.261,"stop":402.194,"duration":44.93},{"text":"In
