Claims.","start":57.259,"stop":63.957,"duration":6.7},{"text":"Now, the decision in the Soriano case was based upon Logronio versus United States in which that Court held that the guerrilla activities

Maritima case which will be argued by Mr. George Foley where the court below which had held for some five years that the six-year limiting statute was applicable to all these claims, no longer applied but more -- did not suspend the operation of the statute of limitations, but it had been suspended by the training with the Enemy Act and that that created a new legal disability, so that it fell within the saving provision and there was only a three-year statute of limitation.","start":115.386,"stop":160.167,"duration":44.78},{"text":"If petitioner is correct, the simplest file in the Court
