And let me just remind you, in answer to your question, Justice Ginsburg, when will the government concede actual harm, it's not dispositive. It's dispositive if the government says there's actual harm, yes, or heavily weighted and possibly dispositive if they say it. But to remind you, as we point out on page 20 of our reply brief, the government hasn't admitted it was actually harmed, except in one case, the Le Blanc-ITT case, in 30 years.","start":3119.165,"stop":3158.795,"duration":39.63},{"text":"So you should not require actual harm.","start":3158.795,"stop":3160.61,"duration":1.82},{"text":"We agree with the government that potential harm, which is important, is captured by the severity factor, but that the lower courts misapplied the severity factor by looking to what risk transpired rather than what risk occurred at the time of the disclosure.

And as to whether there was harm to the judicial system, as Justice Breyer pointed out, in addition to harm to the government, this is a case where a Gulfport jury found fraud against an insurer in the wake of horrible losses from Hurricane Katrina, but the government, whose delegated power the relators are seeking to assert, found after three years of copious investigation -- you can look for yourself on JA214 -- the government found that there -- in the words of the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security at JA14, we find no indication that wind damage was attributed to flooding, or that flood insurance paid for wind damages. If you're concerned nonetheless about any windfall to the defendants, it won't happen, because the government can come in and pick this case and relate the complaint back to the time of the relator's filing And finally, as to the Rigsbys involvement, if you have any factual questions about imputation, of course that can be handled on remand for the application of a proper test that makes willfulness primary, severity assessed, ex-anti not ex-post, and that does consider, as the government conceded it should, the defendant's reputational harm.","start":3204.535,"stop":3274.28,"duration":69.75},{"text":"The government concedes that on page 27, and you should adopt that in your test as the Second Circuit did in Pilon.
