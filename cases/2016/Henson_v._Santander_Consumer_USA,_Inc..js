When Respondent Santander was originally hired to collect Petitioners' defaulted car loans, there's no question that it was collecting the debt owed or due another under anyone's interpretation of that term.","start":14.825,"stop":32.99,"duration":18.17},{"text":"The question in this case is whether that changed when Santander purchased an assignment of that debt. The Fourth Circuit held that it did, wrongly, based on its interpretation of the key phrase \"owed or due another,\" which is used twice in the definition of debt collector, once in the principal definition, and again in the Clause (F) exceptions. The problem with that interpretation is that it cannot be squared with the use of the same phrase in the Clause (F) exceptions, particularly with respect to Clause (F)(iv)","start":32.99,"stop":59.94,"duration":26.95},{"text":"With the Court's indulgence, I would like to walk through that exception.","start":59.94,"stop":65.21,"duration":5.27},{"text":"And it's found on page 4A of the appendix to the blue brief. As I mentioned, this is an exception for somebody who otherwise qualifies as a debt collector under the main definition for somebody who is collecting a debt owed or due another.","start":65.21,"stop":77.65,"duration":12.44},{"text":"And that same requirement is repeated at the beginning of Clause (F)","start":77.65,"stop":81.465,"duration":3.81},{"text":"It has to be somebody -- any person collecting or attempting to collect a debt owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another, and then it says to the extent such activity meets one of four qualifications. And the one I want to focus on is the fourth, and that applies to somebody who's engaged in activity concerning a debt obtained by such person as a secured party in a commercial credit transaction involving the creditor. Now, I think the parties agree with the FTC's interpretation of this.","start":81.465,"stop":107.57,"duration":26.1},{"text":"This is applying to a situation in which a company, like a car dealership, has gotten a commercial loan from a bank and put up as collateral the debts that it's owed by its customers, say, car loans. The only circumstance in which that kind of entity is ever going to be collecting on a consumer debt, which is required at the beginning of Clause (F), is that they've either foreclosed on the collateral, in which case under the UCC, they will send a notice to the -- the consumers saying we have been assigned this debt; start sending the debt to us.","start":107.57,"stop":135.12,"duration":27.55},{"text":"And if the consumer asks for it, they have to send proof of the assignment. Or if the assignment was given to them at the outset as part of the secured credit transaction. The problem for Respondents is that in either case, the bank is only ever going to be doing exactly what a debt purchaser does, which is collecting from the consumers a debt that has been assigned to it and keeping it on its own account. Respondent's only answer to this is to say that this -- no, no, this is a provision that is addressed at the bank that is simply holding the debts as collateral.","start":135.12,"stop":166.615,"duration":31.5},{"text":"But that can't be right, because at the very beginning of (F)(iv) -- or (F) -- and Congress made clear that the exception only applies to somebody who is actually collecting or attempting to collect a debt. And somebody who is simply holding a collateral is not collecting or attempting to collect the consumer debts. Now, as a consequence, adopting Respondent's interpretation that somebody who's collecting on its own account through an assignment, as a debt purchaser does, as the commercial creditor does in the scenario we've just described, in our view, they're not collecting the debt owed or due another.","start":166.615,"stop":198.61,"duration":32},{"text":"And as a consequence, they cannot be the person to whom Congress is referring in subsection (F)(iv)","start":198.61,"stop":204.46,"duration":5.85},{"text":"It is an exception that not only is completely surplusage and a null set, it's a -- an exception that renders itself surplusage.","start":204.46,"stop":212.555,"duration":8.09},{"text":"The beginning of the -- the requirement makes it impossible to satisfy the -- the second set of requirements in (F) -- at the bottom of (F)(iv).

And once we reach that point, then it becomes important, particularly when the same phrase is used again in another part of the definition, to adopt an interpretation that, while it may not be the first one that come to mind the first time it's used, you still need to have an interpretation that allows the same words to do work when repeated later in the subsection. What we have here is, I think, fundamentally is that the word \"owed\" is a participle that's ambiguous.","start":271.63,"stop":309.81,"duration":38.18},{"text":"It is a participle that can both be a past participle, referring to a prior time frame, or a present participle, referring to the present. This Court encountered a very similar set of words in Robinson v. Shell Oil where it was trying to decide whether Title VII, which prohibits an employer from retaliating against its -- its employees, whether that meant its current employees or could also mean its former employees. One of the things the Court did, although it recognized that kind of on first blush you would think current employees, is it looked at the statutory interpretation of \"employee.\" And there, \"employee\" was defined as an individual employed by an employer.","start":309.81,"stop":347.41,"duration":37.6},{"text":"So you had individual employed.","start":347.41,"stop":348.88,"duration":1.47},{"text":"It's the same structure: A noun modified by a gerund -- or by a participle that is in the past tense, but could refer either to somebody previously employed or somebody currently employed.
