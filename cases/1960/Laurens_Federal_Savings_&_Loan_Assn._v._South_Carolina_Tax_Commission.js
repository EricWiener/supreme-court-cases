12 of the United States Code, which was Section 13 of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932, prohibits taxation by the State of South Carolina in the form of -- of a documentary stamp tax, notes given by the Federal Home Loan Bank to -- or to the Federal Home Loan Banks by their member, savings and loan associations over the Nation, two other States, Florida and Pennsylvania, have similar

Carolina has ruled, in effect, that the second Section, 1464 (h), narrowed the exemption from taxation provided by the main section, 1433, and that this reduction or narrowing process enables the States to tax this particular transaction.","start":141.833,"stop":168.487,"duration":26.65},{"text":"Now, the factual situation, may it please the Court, is relatively simple.","start":168.487,"stop":173.98,"duration":5.49},{"text":"The petitioner, Sa -- the Federal Savings and Loan Association here, as do other savings and loan associations, paid under protest and

cents per $100 documentary stamp tax on promissory notes executed in the State.","start":173.98,"stop":215.273,"duration":41.29},{"text":"Now, these taxes of $2200 some represented the documentary

of.","start":215.273,"stop":235.011,"duration":19.74},{"text":"As the Court is aware, of course, these Home Loan Banks are set up in each of the

general exemption from state taxation which is provided to the Federal Home Loan Banks and their transactions by Section 1433 of the Act of 1932 had been so narrowed by Section 1464 (h), which was the Act of 1933, as to permit a taxation of this character.","start":269.807,"stop":306.496,"duration":36.69},{"text":"Briefly stated, may it please the Court, the two sections concerned provide in the pertinent part as follows.","start":306.496,"stop":316.416,"duration":9.92},{"text":"Section 1433 grants to the Federal Home Loan Bank the

itself.","start":416.69,"stop":447.239,"duration":30.55},{"text":"They consider it to be a narrowing by implication, at least, of the 49 -- Section 1433

nondiscriminatory and within the scope of Section 1464 (h) is that this Section gives the States power only to tax these associations on their activities and transactions in the specified areas but, in no way, gives the States the right to tax the transactions between the Federal Home Loan Banks and their members which are specifically exempted by Section 1433.","start":594.423,"stop":636.962,"duration":42.54},{"text":"In other words, Section 1433, if the state court's construction is to be adopted, would have to be, by implication, affected, narrowed,
