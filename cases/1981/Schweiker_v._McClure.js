parts.","start":118.16,"stop":121.879,"duration":3.72},{"text":"Part A provides insurance for hospital and related post-hospital services, and is fully funded by payroll taxes paid to the federal government through the social security system.","start":121.879,"stop":133.337,"duration":11.46},{"text":"Part B, which is involved here, provides a voluntary program of supplementary medical insurance covering in general 80 percent of the reasonable charges for certain other services, primarily physicians' services and such items as medical supplies, laboratory tests, and ex-rays.","start":133.337,"stop":153.833,"duration":20.5},{"text":"Benefits under Part B are financed in part by direct federal government contributions and in part by monthly premiums paid by people who are 65 years of age or older or disabled and who choose voluntarily to enroll in the Part B program.","start":153.833,"stop":170.359,"duration":16.53},{"text":"Under the Medicare statute, the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines whether an individual is eligible to enroll in the Part B program.","start":170.359,"stop":180.817,"duration":10.46},{"text":"If the Secretary determines that an applicant is not eligible, the applicant has an opportunity for a hearing before an administrative law judge, and if necessary, to judicial review of that determination.","start":180.817,"stop":192.89,"duration":12.07},{"text":"Now, in contrast to these eligibility determinations, the individual benefit reimbursement determinations under the Part B program are not handled directly by the Secretary.","start":192.89,"stop":204.932,"duration":12.04},{"text":"The day to day administration of the Part B program requires a determination of a vast

of this magnitude and complexity could be administered most efficiently and conveniently by private insurance carriers, because these carriers, in conducting their own insurance business, had acquired considerable experience and expertise in determining whether, for example, physicians' services are medically necessary and in calculating the reasonable charge for a variety of medical services in their particular community.","start":224.177,"stop":258.333,"duration":34.16},{"text":"Accordingly, Congress in the Medicare Act authorized the Secretary to enter into contracts with private insurance

decision.","start":301.694,"stop":311.534,"duration":9.84},{"text":"Under regulations promulgated by the Secretary, if a claimant does not agree with the carrier's initial decision regarding the amount of reimbursement for particular services, the claimant may require a review of that initial determination.","start":311.534,"stop":328.077,"duration":16.54},{"text":"A review of the entire file

the claim at issue.","start":328.077,"stop":341.068,"duration":12.99},{"text":"If after that review determination the claimant is still not satisfied with the carrier's decision, the Medicare Act
