Court:","start":10.434,"stop":14.667,"duration":4.23},{"text":"The case is here on appeal from a divided court of appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.","start":14.667,"stop":21.602,"duration":6.94},{"text":"The case presents the questions of whether the prohibitions and limitations on trade association solicitation contained in 1976 Amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act can survive the exacting scrutiny demanded by the First and Fifth Amendments.","start":21.602,"stop":38.861,"duration":17.26},{"text":"It is our position in brief that the restrictions and limitations are unconstitutional.","start":38.861,"stop":44.076,"duration":5.22},{"text":"I think in order to fully appreciate the genesis of the case and the precise nature of the prohibitions that are involved, one must go back to a time prior to May of 1976, which was the effective date of the 1976 Amendments.","start":44.076,"stop":60.274,"duration":16.2},{"text":"Prior to that time, trade associations solicited voluntary political contributions from a wide and broad range of people, basically who fell within... people who shared a commonality or affinity of political interests.","start":60.274,"stop":77.595,"duration":17.32},{"text":"Those political solicitations were undertaken without regard to whether or not the prospective contributor was an employee of a member corporation of the trade association.","start":77.595,"stop":92.308,"duration":14.71},{"text":"And, most importantly, they were undertaken without obtaining the prior permission of anyone.","start":92.308,"stop":97.852,"duration":5.54},{"text":"With the coming of the 1967 Amendments, however, trade association solicitation underwent a radical and drastic transformation.","start":97.852,"stop":105.787,"duration":7.94},{"text":"For now, no longer could trade associations solicit from this rather broad group of people who shared a commonality of purpose and interests; rather, they were restricted by the Act to either their own shareholders or their own executives and administrators... and that range of people was very small by virtue of the inherent characteristics of trade associations... and/or they could solicit the executives and administrative personnel and the stockholders of those member corporations.","start":105.787,"stop":140.43,"duration":34.64},{"text":"But in addition to these restrictions, perhaps the most throttling restriction was that before even that narrow solicitation could be undertaken, the trade association political action committee had to receive the permission from the member corporation.","start":140.43,"stop":159.296,"duration":18.87},{"text":"That is to say, the executive or administrative employee could not make a determination on his own of whether or not he wanted to be solicited.","start":159.296,"stop":167.667,"duration":8.37},{"text":"That task was entrusted by the Act to the corporation.","start":167.667,"stop":173.602,"duration":5.94},{"text":"The corporation had sole and unthrottled discretion in the matter.","start":173.602,"stop":176.555,"duration":2.95},{"text":"It was unreviewable by anybody, and indeed, it could be denied without regard to the wishes of the corporate employee himself.","start":176.555,"stop":184.629,"duration":8.07},{"text":"In addition to that restriction, the Act imposed one final restriction, and that was even if all of the other statutory prohibitions had been satisfied, and even if the corporation in its largesse gave permission, the potential contributor could only be solicited by one trade association, regardless of the amount of overlap of membership in other separate, distinct and autonomous associations.","start":184.629,"stop":214.602,"duration":29.97}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Cole, is there anything in the Act that prevents a trade association from seeking to add these people as members of the trade association?","start":214.602,"stop":223.895,"duration":9.29}]},{"speakerName":"Jeffrey Cole","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, there is absolutely nothing except the practical realities of life.","start":223.895,"stop":228.3,"duration":4.41},{"text":"The Act itself, as you rightly point out, does not restrict a trade association from going out and soliciting people to join with it as a member.","start":228.3,"stop":236.374,"duration":8.07},{"text":"The difficulty is, and the record makes clear, that trade associations have rather large operating budgets.","start":236.374,"stop":243.95,"duration":7.58},{"text":"Individuals do not have the wherewithal... and I suspect they do not have the inclination... to be able to support a trade association's activities.","start":243.95,"stop":254.664,"duration":10.71},{"text":"So the right to solicit for individual membership is largely illusory.","start":254.664,"stop":260.895,"duration":6.23},{"text":"But even if it were not, Your Honor, if underlying your question is the suggestion that has been made by the government that we could thus avoid the restraints of the sections of the Act, then I think we are giving constitutional significance to an irrelevancy.","start":260.895,"stop":276.343,"duration":15.45},{"text":"I am aware of no case in the history of this Court, or any court, which has said otherwise unconstitutional prohibitions are okay and are palatable simply because there is a method of avoiding them.","start":276.343,"stop":293.852,"duration":17.51},{"text":"And that is what the Seventh Circuit said and that is what the government is suggesting to this Court.","start":293.852,"stop":299.426,"duration":5.57},{"text":"The effect of these various restrictions, both collectively and individually, was I think as the district court's unchallenged findings of fact make clear, at once profound and immediate.","start":299.426,"stop":315.108,"duration":15.68},{"text":"The district court found that the Act found that the Act had substantially curtailed the solicitation activities of the trade associations; that it had impaired substantially their right to collect voluntary political contributions and thus to make further contributions; and perhaps most importantly, it had limited the rights of potential solicitees, those people having this commonality of political interests, from being able to affiliate with the trade association political action committee and with other like-minded people.","start":315.108,"stop":348.907,"duration":33.8},{"text":"As a consequence of these restraints and as a consequence of the impositions imposed by the Act, we filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District for Illinois.","start":348.907,"stop":360.262,"duration":11.36},{"text":"After some very protracted proceedings in that court and in the Court of Appeals, the case ultimately came on for hearing before the Seventh Circuit sitting en banc pursuant to Section 437h of the Act.","start":360.262,"stop":374.351,"duration":14.09},{"text":"The decision of the court below was divided in some instances and unanimous in others.","start":374.351,"stop":387.079,"duration":12.73},{"text":"The court unanimously held that the plaintiffs had standing under 2 U.S.C. 437h to maintain the action.","start":387.079,"stop":388.016,"duration":0.94},{"text":"The court, however--","start":388.016,"stop":389.406,"duration":1.39}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Cole, on that point, how does the committee fit under the language of the statute, 437h, as a plaintiff?","start":389.406,"stop":401.324,"duration":11.92}]},{"speakerName":"Jeffrey Cole","textObjs":[{"text":"--We certainly do not contend that we fit within the explicit enumerated categories of people set forth in 437h.","start":401.324,"stop":409.93,"duration":8.61},{"text":"We are not the Federal Election Commission, and we are certainly not the National Committee of a political party, and we are certainly not, as an entity, individuals eligible to vote.","start":409.93,"stop":421.3,"duration":11.37},{"text":"Although, Your Honor, let me point out that our members, at least the members of the Political Action Committees themselves, which are separate, distinct entities as this Court held in California Medical Association, are comprised solely and completely of members, of individuals.","start":421.3,"stop":437.183,"duration":15.88},{"text":"The Federal Election Commission has never contested that point from the time the Seventh Circuit panel announced its decision in 1979 saying that aside from everything else, the plaintiffs had associational standing under the rules of this Court by virtue of our representation of individuals.","start":437.183,"stop":457.832,"duration":20.65},{"text":"The Commission has never suggested or said that we do not represent individuals.","start":457.832,"stop":463.329,"duration":5.5},{"text":"They simply have said that we don't fall within the literal language of the statute.","start":463.329,"stop":467.765,"duration":4.44},{"text":"So I think, Your Honor, that we have associational standing without any question at all, but beyond that, it seems to me that merely because we don't fall within the explicit enumerations of the Act does not mean that we are not a proper party.","start":467.765,"stop":481.822,"duration":14.06},{"text":"The purpose of that statute, 437h, as this court unequivocally held in Buckley, was to provide standing to the limit of Article III of the Constitution.","start":481.822,"stop":493.317,"duration":11.5},{"text":"That beneficent purpose cannot possibly be fulfilled if only the three explicitly enumerated parties are accorded standing.","start":493.317,"stop":502.765,"duration":9.45},{"text":"It would mean that unions, trade associations and corporations, who are the entities most intimately and profoundly affected by the 1976 Amendments, at least in the context of this case, could not maintain an action under 437h, even though an anonymous voter from Boise, Idaho who had absolutely no interest in the particular provisions could come into court, get the substantially expedited review that the statute allows, while unions, corporations and others--","start":502.765,"stop":535.128,"duration":32.36}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, is this an argument that if Congress, after enumerating those three, had said \"and no one else\", the statute would be unconstitutional?","start":535.128,"stop":544.732,"duration":9.6}]},{"speakerName":"Jeffrey Cole","textObjs":[{"text":"--I think, Mr. Justice Brennan, that the Congress perhaps could well have suggested that only those three explicitly-enumerated categories of people could avail themselves of the Act.","start":544.732,"stop":559.945,"duration":15.21},{"text":"The question is, though, it does not say \"and only those\".","start":559.945,"stop":563.756,"duration":3.81},{"text":"And thus, one must divine the legislative intent underlying that statute.","start":563.756,"stop":570.644,"duration":6.89}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"But if it is to read as if \"and only those\" appeared, you would have no challenge to its constitutionality?","start":570.644,"stop":576.704,"duration":6.06}]},{"speakerName":"Jeffrey Cole","textObjs":[{"text":"I think we would not.","start":576.704,"stop":578.047,"duration":1.34},{"text":"We have certainly not made any.","start":578.047,"stop":579.907,"duration":1.86}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"The statute is certainly quite explicit in identifying three entities, is it not?","start":579.907,"stop":585.357,"duration":5.45}]},{"speakerName":"Jeffrey Cole","textObjs":[{"text":"If by that, Mr. Chief Justice, you mean it is meant to be explicitly exclusive, I disagree with you.","start":585.357,"stop":591.386,"duration":6.03},{"text":"If you mean it says what it says, of course I agree with you.","start":591.386,"stop":594.76,"duration":3.37},{"text":"But I recall Mr. Justice Frankfurter's admonition that the notion that because the words of the statute are plain it's meaning is also plain is pernicious over-simplification.","start":594.76,"stop":603.428,"duration":8.67},{"text":"And one must look at the legislative intent underlying the statute, and the intent clearly is to provide expedition in appellate review, and the certainty of review by this Court.","start":603.428,"stop":614.331,"duration":10.9},{"text":"And that's perhaps the most important factor.","start":614.331,"stop":619.109,"duration":4.78}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Justice Frankfurther also said when the language of the statute is clear, that we don't need to

Cole","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes.","start":625.091,"stop":625.779,"duration":0.69},{"text":"And the language of the statute certainly is not clear.","start":625.779,"stop":626.873,"duration":1.09},{"text":"This Court, in the Bogus case, has referred to the inexactitude of congressional language in the Act itself.","start":626.873,"stop":633.009,"duration":6.14}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Sometimes when it's clear we also look at the legislative history.","start":633.009,"stop":636.883,"duration":3.87}]},{"speakerName":"Jeffrey Cole","textObjs":[{"text":"I think you do often, Your Honor.","start":636.883,"stop":638.524,"duration":1.64}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"You could have added an officer of the association, couldn't you?","start":638.524,"stop":641.912,"duration":3.39}]},{"speakerName":"Jeffrey Cole","textObjs":[{"text":"Are you asking me could we have?","start":641.912,"stop":646.208,"duration":4.3}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes.","start":646.208,"stop":646.943,"duration":0.74}]},{"speakerName":"Jeffrey Cole","textObjs":[{"text":"There was some question at the time of the availability of people to come in.","start":646.943,"stop":651.487,"duration":4.54},{"text":"It was our view that the statute was at least to us clear that it would be incongruous to read the statute in the way the FEC has done, and that we didn't need anybody.","start":651.487,"stop":659.859,"duration":8.37},{"text":"And the case ultimately progressed as it did.","start":659.859,"stop":662.873,"duration":3.01},{"text":"Interestingly enough, had we brought in an officer of one of the plaintiffs, the FEC would have contested, as it did in the California Medical Association case, that the identity of the officer and the identity of the corporate entity were fully congruent and thus, that individual had no standing, although he fell, Your Honor, within the literal language of 437h.","start":662.873,"stop":684.724,"duration":21.85}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"I suppose your position is that if this case were thrown out because of a narrow interpretation of that sentence, that the entire purpose of Congress in getting expedited review of the constitutional questions would be

of the Seventh Circuit... and I think our briefs... explain in some detail precisely why that is so.","start":701.013,"stop":708.323,"duration":7.31},{"text":"I must again underscore the fact, Your Honor, even if you were to read the statute in a very narrow way, it seems to me that we would still have standing under 437 in this case under accepted and established and I think unquestioned principles of associational standing.","start":708.323,"stop":722.13,"duration":13.81}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Do you allege in your complaint, or did you prove, that the

not.","start":733.111,"stop":733.844,"duration":0.73},{"text":"And let me tell you, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in retrospect, why that was not done.","start":733.844,"stop":738.859,"duration":5.01},{"text":"When the Seventh Circuit announced its opinion in December of 1979, it articulated the proposition that we had associational standing by virtue of the individual members that the plaintiffs possess.","start":738.859,"stop":751.727,"duration":12.87},{"text":"Now, thereafter, there were long proceedings involving discovery, the preparation of stipulated facts and so on.","start":751.727,"stop":761.599,"duration":9.87},{"text":"The Commission never once suggested, ever, that out of the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of individual people who were contributors and thus members of the PAC's, that these people, at least one of them, was not an individual voter.","start":761.599,"stop":774.734,"duration":13.13},{"text":"And thus, the need for proof never arose.","start":774.734,"stop":775.156,"duration":0.42}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"But the need for allegation may have arisen.","start":775.156,"stop":779.467,"duration":4.31}]},{"speakerName":"Jeffrey Cole","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I think that the Seventh Circuit was very clear, as all of us were at the time, that we were not representing people who were 14 and 15 and 16 years old.","start":779.467,"stop":791.837,"duration":12.37},{"text":"The people that we were representing were people who were intimately concerned with and involved in the political process.","start":791.837,"stop":797.193,"duration":5.36},{"text":"And clearly, at least one of them was eligible to vote, and the government never suggested to the contrary.","start":797.193,"stop":800.677,"duration":3.48}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"But even if the members were eligible to vote, does it necessarily follow

Stevens.","start":817.655,"stop":820.966,"duration":3.31},{"text":"If one looks at the Buckley case, for example, there is a statement in Buckley in which this Court said at least some of the appellants have standing.","start":820.966,"stop":829.493,"duration":8.53},{"text":"Immediately following that statement, appeared footnote 10.","start":829.493,"stop":831.336,"duration":1.84},{"text":"And in that footnote, the Court did not make any reference to the individual plaintiffs who clearly were involved in the case.","start":831.336,"stop":838.848,"duration":7.51},{"text":"Senator Buckley obviously was eligible to vote, and I think the allegations were made in that complaint.","start":838.848,"stop":843.722,"duration":4.87},{"text":"Instead, the Court focused upon the organizational nature of the plaintiffs who under the government's reading, and under a cramped review of 437h, would not have standing.","start":843.722,"stop":855.171,"duration":11.45},{"text":"Now, unless we are to attribute to this Court and to its law secretaries an exceedingly high degree of caprice, I think that focus on the organizational rather than the individual plaintiffs must have some significance.","start":855.171,"stop":868.932,"duration":13.76},{"text":"That is what--","start":868.932,"stop":869.679,"duration":0.75}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"But there were many challenges in that case.","start":869.679,"stop":874.428,"duration":4.75},{"text":"Here the only challenge is that the statute restricts the activities of the association, as I understand it.","start":874.428,"stop":880.769,"duration":6.34},{"text":"And you're suggesting that--","start":880.769,"stop":881.128,"duration":0.36}]},{"speakerName":"Jeffrey Cole","textObjs":[{"text":"--No, Your Honor, that's not right.","start":881.128,"stop":881.55,"duration":0.42},{"text":"The allegations are clear on the face of the complaint, and that is that the impact adversely on not only the rights of the trade associations and the political action committees, but indeed... and we explicitly noted this in the complaint, and it is in I think one of our briefs, either our opening or reply brief... that it also impacted adversely on the right of prospective solicitees.","start":881.55,"stop":904.072,"duration":22.52},{"text":"That is, the corporate executives, administrators and stockholders of our member corporations.","start":904.072,"stop":909.852,"duration":5.78},{"text":"And I agree with you, Mr. Justice Stevens, there were many, many challenges at issue in Buckley.","start":909.852,"stop":917.207,"duration":7.36},{"text":"But all of those challenges jurisdictionally were subsumed under 437h.","start":917.207,"stop":922.004,"duration":4.8},{"text":"So the diversity of the challenges, I think, does not speak to the question of the Court's underlying jurisdiction.","start":922.004,"stop":929.688,"duration":7.68},{"text":"And the Court's focus, unlike the district court's focus in Buckley, was not on the individual plaintiffs; it was rather upon the organizational plaintiffs who had associational or organizational standing.","start":929.688,"stop":941.011,"duration":11.32}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"--Then how do you read the statute?","start":941.011,"stop":942.682,"duration":1.67},{"text":"You say that listed persons and anybody else who might be adversely affected by anything in the statute has the standing to make a challenge.","start":942.682,"stop":949.444,"duration":6.76}]},{"speakerName":"Jeffrey Cole","textObjs":[{"text":"I think the statute, Your Honor, was designed to expand rather than to contract

does.","start":954.13,"stop":954.911,"duration":0.78},{"text":"It gives certain remedies to certain specific people that they wouldn't otherwise
