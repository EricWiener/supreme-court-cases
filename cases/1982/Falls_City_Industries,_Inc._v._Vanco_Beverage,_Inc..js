that the act places emphasis on individual situations and doesn't apply to the adoption of an overall pricing structure.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Secondly... the second proposition that the court articulated was that the... 2(b) didn't apply because the discriminatory pricing resulted not from... from price increases in Indiana, not from price decreases;

that the decision of the Court of Appeals is in error and should be reversed.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Both the Seventh Circuit and the District Court believe that the meeting

price increases rather than outright price cuts.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In this situation the lower price of the seller, even though it is the end product of a moderate price increase, may well be a form of competitive self-defense of the very kind which Congress meant to protect.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In addition, if the law really did require what the Court of Appeals said, then sellers like Falls City would be enforced to engage in costly and artificial conduct such as hiking all of their prices to a particular level for a period of time and

economy.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The district court also was of the view that the meeting competition defense requires proof that prices were adjusted on a customer-by-customer basis, and in affirming the district court, the Court of Appeals used language indicating that it was of this same view.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"This also was a mistaken interpretation of the statute.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Section 2(b) permits a price difference if the seller shows that his lower price to a purchaser or to a group of purchasers was made in good faith to meet the price of a rival.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The test, as this Court frequently has held, is flexible and pragmatic, not technical or doctrinaire.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The seller need only show a reasonable and good faith effort to meet the forces of competition.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The statute doesn't attempt to dictate what method the seller must use in different market situations.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Nothing in the statute or its legislative history says that a seller cannot adopt an area-wide price when that's reasonably necessary to meet actual competition.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"As the facts of this case show, the seller's rival may have a single price of its own throughout the entire region, or a group of sellers of slightly different products may have a range of prices.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In either event, a single price which is reasonably adjusted to meet actual competition prevailing in the area is a permissible response.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Customer-by-customer pricing

City's meeting competition defense here.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Staley rested on the conclusion that the sellers there lacked good faith because they copied an artificial basing point system which imposed substantial phantom or unearned freight charges on particular purchasers.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The court concluded that the basing point system was inherently unlawful under the Robinson-Patman Act, and therefore its adoption could not be characterized as good faith action.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In addition, the FTC explained
