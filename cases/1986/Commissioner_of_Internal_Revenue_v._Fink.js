Williamson","textObjs":[{"text":"It is at least, according to this Court in [inaudible] the equivalent of the criminal beyond a reasonable doubt.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"I don't think of beyond a reasonable doubt as being doubt free.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Donald J. Williamson","textObjs":[{"text":"The language of clear, convincing and unequivocal which does not leave any issue in doubt, I would characterize as doubt free.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, clear and convincing has been thought of a standard between a preponderance and beyond a reasonable doubt.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Donald J. Williamson","textObjs":[{"text":"But, this Court went further in Schneiderman to indicate that it not only has to be clear, convincing and unequivocal, but it will leave no issue in doubt and any inference of fact or law as far as reasonably as possible it should be drawn in favor of the citizen.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But, I would argue in terms of the application to this case that doubt free is more of a short end expression in my having to completely repeat each time that language of the Court.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But nevertheless, if we're to take literally the Chaunt second prong of the second expression of the second prong then this Court is likewise free to take literally the language in Schneiderman which is doubt free and which in the concurring opinions is fairly clear that this Court was trying to avoid any potentiality of having two classes of citizenship and therefore did in fact make the standard of proof as vigorous as possible.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"When the applications of the fact to this particular case the District Court was able to apply all of the formulations of Chaunt and Fedorenko, taken in combination, and under none of those standards did it find the misrepresentations to be material.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"What happened here however is that the Third Circuit tried to get from point A, the suppressed truth by drawing an inference as to a residency permit in which correspondence indicated that it was issued without special restrictions and from that it drew a tendentious inference that that would have led to a conclusion that the naturalized citizen was not a victim of Nazi persecution.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"I think we demonstrate fairly clearly that the law and the regulations at that time had no such requirement that one had to be a victim of Nazi persecution.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"So that the ultimate disqualifying fact to which the Third Circuit, I reach this conclusion is in essence a false premise and its logic was bound to face since it didn't exist.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But in addition to which the case illustrates that you cannot have a standard which you can characterize as it did as probability and still in effect comply with safeguarding the rights of the denaturalized citizens.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Because what they did there is they turned Schneiderman upside down and instead of drawing the inferences in favor of the citizen they draw the most tenuous inference in favor of a government.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In point of fact, the inference is neutral because every person whether or not a citizen of Germany at the Third Reich at that time, or even today, who is in Germany whether it be a citizen, or displaced person, or foreigner, has to register and the registration is a simple bureaucratic act.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"All it does is establish that the neutral fact that one resided in Tubingen.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Now the irony is that the establishment of the residence in Poltringen rather, at that time, established that the petitioner was a displaced person who was covered by the Presidential Directive of December 22nd, 1945.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Now that was incorporated specifically on December of 1946, in the Federal Regulations incorporated the Truman Directive as part of the priority for Non-preference Immigration Quota Visas.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The Third Circuit looked at the President Truman Directive in isolation and did not take into consideration that indeed it was incorporated in the regulations.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"As a result of which they came to the improper conclusion that was a mere generalized statement instead of in fact a Presidential Order directing that all displaced persons would, in effect, receive a priority under a Non-preference Quota Immigration Visa standard.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"This Court has never applied the second prong of Chaunt even in Chaunt.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And as a result of which it is dicta and I would submit that if it is to be taken literally, it is impossible to reconcile the dicta in the second prong of Chaunt with the Schneiderman test.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"What has happened is we have two formulations in Chaunt within two pages.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"One on Page 353 and one Page 355.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The latter one picks up the word, \"possibly\", and the question has in effect, plagued the Courts of Appeals as to how one applies the test and where, in effect, what part of the phraseology it modifies.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Whereas it is reasonably clear that in Chaunt this Court in effect did say that you had to connect the suppressed fact, there the arrests, to an ultimate disqualifying fact, their communist affiliation, and what the Court said is that the attempted connection by the government at that time was too tenuous and in addition to which it said as part of its holding that no investigation would have been conducted because there, there was a disclosure which, in effect, that disclosure did precipitate an investigation.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Similarly here, although the petitioner did in fact misstate his date and town of birth, he disclosed his residence in Poltringen and in Tubingen in Germany prior to the end of the war.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"That was disclosed and it did not trigger off an investigation by the Vice Counsel to look at the records in Tubingen.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But we don't know that it did not because the Vice Counsel in effect, indicates in the application for visa, police dossier available.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"A police dossier meant that they went to the available public records of the jurisdiction in which the individual resided.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"So that presumably we would have gone to Poltringen or Tubingen and what would they have found?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Contrary to the indications of faulty review by the Third Circuit, they would have found the original document which we have in our Joint Appendix.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"That is the original register of Ammerbuch, which in effect is the district which controlled the residential permits there.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And there it contains the same information which is reflected in the internal passport.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"It contains the statement that he was born in Kaunas and born in Canniest on the incorrect date.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"So that in point of fact there is no connection, proper connection on the factual basis to go from point A, the truth of the true date and place of birth which the District Court properly held would not have led anywhere because that would not have created any type of suspicion.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In addition to which it could not connect to something which is the residence rather the appropriate fact was to disclose fact which connected to the residence and which is his residence in Poltringen which is on the application.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But in any event, the whole exercise is an exercise in futility if at the end the ultimate disqualifying fact doesn't exist.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"There was no requirement that one had to be a victim of Nazi persecution in order to get a visa.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And equally important there is no exclusion which excludes someone who's not a victim of Nazi persecution from obtaining a visa.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"This naturalized citizen received his visa under the 1924 Act and the Third Circuit at least says that you should determine the validity of either the visa or the citizenship petition judged by the law in effect at the time that he obtained it.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Under the 1924 Act, since he received his visa in 1948 having applied for it in February of 1947, the law at that time was that the visa shall specify the nationality, which quota the immigrant is coming into and such additional information necessary for the proper enforcement of the immigration laws.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And what they provided for is one form, but that one form was an attempt to cover many different applications.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"As a result of which some of the questions that are asked in the form have no relevance or in the standards here no materiality to the ultimate decision to be arrived at.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"By way of illustration the form requires that you set forth your age.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Of course the age is relevant if you are attempting to obtain a first preference because, excuse me, a second preference, obtain a second preference because the second preference is available to unmarried children under the age of 21 years old.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Obviously if the petitioner attempted to make himself, an alien, an unmarried alien under the age of 21 years then clearly that would have been material.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But the difference of the two years from 30 to 32 years was meaningless piece of information.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"It was not necessary for the proper enforcement of the immigration laws at that time.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Similarly, he did not attempt, for example, it asked whether or not he's married and indeed he disclosed the fact of his marriage, but that marriage had no relevance to the Non-preference Immigration Quota Visa which he obtained.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Although it would have had relevance to a first preference, so that in point of fact information is requested in that form which is not necessary to enforcement of the laws.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In addition to which the Act of--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr.
