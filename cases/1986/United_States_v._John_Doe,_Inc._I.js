you.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The first question presented in this case is the question reserved in footnote 15 in the Sells Engineering case: whether attorneys, in this case in the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, who had conducted a grand jury investigation into possible bid-rigging and price-fixing and who were thereafter instructed to consider and ultimately to bring a civil action for injunctive relief and damages to the United States could review their own memoranda, the grand jury transcripts committed to their custody under Criminal Rule 6(e)(1), and other documents properly in their possession, without obtaining a court order under Rule 6(e).","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"When Respondents were notified that the Antitrust Division had decided to bring a civil suit, they sought a protective order prohibiting the filing of the complaint on the ground that it would improperly disclose matters occurring before the grand jury and also prohibiting these same attorneys from referring to grand jury material in preparing, filing, or litigating the civil case.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The district court denied the protective order.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The Court of Appeals agreed with the district court as to the complaint, finding that it did not","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"\"quote from or refer to any grand jury transcripts or documents subpoenaed by the grand jury, and does not mention any witnesses before the grand jury or even refer to the existence of a grand jury.\"","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But the court prohibited any further access to grand jury materials by these attorneys without a Rule 6(e) order.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"We think the latter ruling was error and that government attorneys who have conducted a grand jury proceeding and who have been directed to conduct a civil phase of the dispute need not obtain what we have called a threshold 6(e) order before they may review grand jury materials properly in their possession.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"To begin with, the plain language of the rule prohibits government attorneys from disclosing matters occurring before the grand jury without a 6(e) order.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Disclosure occurs when information is revealed to at least one new person and not, we think, when the same people review their own memoranda and other familiar materials.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The plain language we think is well chosen.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The prohibition of disclosure to new people is what is needed to serve the repeatedly stated traditional purposes of grand jury secrecy: to shield witnesses and the grand jurors themselves from tampering, to prevent flight, to protect the innocent.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"That's a list of grand jury purposes that the Court has stated repeatedly, and none of them, we think, suggests any reason why, when Department attorneys who conducted a attorney investigation are available to bring a civil case, to collect money owed to the United States on account of the same conduct, and they can do so without disclosing matters occurring before the grand jury to any other person, why in that situation the government should nevertheless have to start a civil investigation from scratch.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"One comment the Court of Appeals made on this was to echo, but really extend, a point that this Court made in Sells, the concern that civil use of grand jury materials might inhibit witnesses appearing before the grand jury from testifying fully and candidly.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And I want to comment on that.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"It seems to me that that can't be right in this context.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In the first place, I find it hard to imagine a grand jury witness who is not inhibited by the threat of criminal prosecution and is not inhibited by the other possibilities for disclosure of his testimony being inhibited by the fact that he may be sued civilly.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But if he is, it seems to me that it cannot be the purpose of Rule 6(e) to give such a witness the false impression that if he testifies in a way that suggests he may have some liability to the United States that won't be followed up and the United States won't attempt to collect.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"For example, in this case the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division received at the end of the grand jury investigation extensive memoranda summarizing the investigation and making recommendations about the future prosecution of the case.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"He decided on the basis of that memorandum that a criminal prosecution should not be brought, but that the possibility of a civil case should be further explored, and that civil case was ultimately authorized.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Unless we are to have... and I don't think the Respondents are asking for and I see no possible warrant in Rule 6(e) for... a rule that the grand jury proceedings are to be entirely sealed off and no information from them is ever, even in this sense, to reach anyone who might consider a civil case, in other words unless we're to have a rule that says the Assistant Attorney General who decides whether or not to bring a criminal prosecution may not thereafter decide whether to bring a civil case, there simply is no realistic possibility of assuring grand jury witnesses that what they say may not be used against them civilly.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Now, the Respondents we think would like to go beyond the traditional purposes of grand jury secrecy and to make of Rule 6(e) an exclusionary rule.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The nub of the problem, it seems to me, is right there.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"A bona fide grand jury investigation is not an unconstitutional search, and Rule 6(e) is not an exclusionary rule.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Respondents of course object that the grand jury investigation may not be bona fide, that allowing grand jury attorneys to review civil... to review grand jury materials during the civil phase may lead to the misuse of the grand jury to gather evidence for civil cases.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The Court of Appeals rejected that argument here, finding no reason to think that the attorneys had misused the grand jury in this case and no incentive for misuse in any antitrust case, in view of the division's civil discovery powers.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And I can add that I think such misuse is rare or nonexistent.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But in any event, a threshold 6(e) order, a threshold 6(e) proceeding to determine whether the same attorneys can participate at all and can review materials properly in their own possession, is not, I suggest, the way to deal with any such misuse.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Where the attorneys who conducted the grand jury are also conducting civil discovery and trial, the proper moment to deal with a claim that the grand jury gathered evidence that had no bona fide criminal investigative purpose is when the defendant makes such a claim in the civil proceedings.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Defense counsel, who frequently will have lived through the grand jury investigation too, will not be slow to claim that the grand jury gathered evidence that was not relevant to a proper criminal charge, and the court, having the same attorneys before it, can immediately inquire into such a claim and, if it proves well founded, impose an appropriate remedy.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The alternative implicitly suggested by the Respondents is that the grand jury attorneys should be required to go to court for a threshold 6(e) hearing, which would presumably be ex parte, and seek to demonstrate that the grand jury proceedings were conducted in good faith and did not gather any evidence that was not properly part of a criminal investigation.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"After demonstrating that, presumably they could review the materials in their own possession.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But that approach, a sort of presumption of irregularity, is not called for by 6(e), is not, we suggest, an efficient way to get at the truth... ex parte hearings to prove a negative rarely are... and will not dispose of the matter, because the defendant will still have the right to make his claim of misuse.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Respondents also object--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"What is your idea of what 6(e) means?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"--We think that 6(e) provides that those persons who properly have access to grand jury materials may not disclose them to other people without a court order.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"That's what this case is about.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Would the court order be routine?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"No.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The court order would require a showing of particularized need under this Court's decision in Sells.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"There would be a hearing on it?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The question is whether any purpose is served and whether the rule requires this threshold hearing.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Respondents argue that attorneys on the prosecution team will inevitably disclose the workings of the grand jury to other people during discovery or trial of a civil case.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"That objection, I note, really speaks not to whether such attorneys should be allowed to review their materials, but to a contention that they are not... that they are not making, whether such attorneys may participate in the civil case at all.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But we think it is wrong, for two reasons:","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"First, they greatly exaggerate the likelihood of such public disclosure by misapprehending what it is that is required to be kept secret.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Facts about persons' conduct do not become privileged merely because the grand jury has investigated it.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"What is secret is the workings of the grand jury, and it is perfectly possible to draft a complaint, as we did here, that does not tell anyone about the grand jury, and to conduct discovery and trial without doing so.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Cohen, I find the phrase","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"\"the workings of the grand jury.\"","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"less than totally clear as to just what we're talking about.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"You know, certainly if one were to say it takes 23 people to be a grand jury, it has to be an indictment by a majority, you would say that's the workings of the grand jury.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Yet obviously that isn't prohibited from disclosure.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"No, and that is not what I meant.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Thank you for giving me an opportunity to clarify that.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"By the workings of the grand jury, I mean the particular activities of the particular grand jury, including what witnesses it heard, what those witnesses testified to, when it met, what documents it reviewed.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But the activities of the grand jury as such... to take an example, a pre-existing document which is subpoenaed by the grand jury does not become immune from later disclosure merely because it was subpoenaed by the grand jury, unless its later disclosure would disclose something about what the grand jury's activities were.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, what if the government subpoenaed a whole bunch of documents from a particular witness before the grand jury.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The government didn't know of any specific document in this group before, and all of these documents were examined by the grand jury.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Now, could a government attorney then go out and say, well, look, contract such-and-such provided such-and-such?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"I'm not sure what you mean by \"go out and say\".","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, tell it to someone to whom disclosure is not authorized.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"I don't think that the fact that a particular contract was subpoenaed by the grand jury makes that contract privileged from future disclosure in circumstances where the disclosure would not reveal what the grand jury's activities were.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, what if a witness is subpoenaed before the grand jury and the witness says: On February 5th I met with Joe Jones.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Can the attorney then go out, the government attorney, and disclose to another person that witness X said on February 5th he met with Joe Jones?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"No.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"On the other hand, the same testimony can be elicited in discovery or in trial in a context in which it does not reveal the workings of a grand jury.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Cohen, may I just follow up with the Chief Justice's question.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Supposing they were drafting a civil complaint and the key allegation was there was a meeting between two persons agreeing on prices at a specific time, date, and place; and that the only evidence the government had of that was a written document that had been subpoenaed before the grand jury.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Could they file such a complaint without a 6(e) order?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Again, that complaint does not disclose anything about the activities of the grand jury.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Even though at least some people within the government, knowing the full scope of the government's civil investigation, some people would know that the only place that information could have come from was the grand jury?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, that's of course not the case here.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"No, that was no question.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The specific person who drafted the complaint had no other source of information except the grand jury transcript or grand jury document.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Could he file such a complaint?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"You say yes.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Now, we have to prove our case, and we have to prove our case by admissible evidence, and we have to prove it by disclosable evidence.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But such a complaint could be filed, and to the extent necessary civil discovery could then be conducted.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And the whole case could, as indeed this case could--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Let me just follow up.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Supposing in the pretrial discovery in the civil case the defendant asks the government in substance, what is the source of... what is the evidence supporting that allegation or something.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Could they answer that interrogatory without a court order?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Identify the witnesses who can so testify or the documents which will support that allegation?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"--Again, I think the answer is usually yes, they could, because it ought to be possible to frame an answer to that question that does not identify the grand jury proceedings as the source of that information.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Just identifies the name of the person who happened to be a witness and the government had never talked to except in that--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"But it doesn't identify him as a witness.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"--I assume that the civil division lawyer or the criminal division lawyer assigned to the civil division who's working with someone else in that division.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"How could he possibly not be disclosing to the person that he's working with that he has all sorts of information that this person must assume came from the grand jury?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"We don't--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"He says witness X will say thus and such, right.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"So his colleague says, how do you know that?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"He says, well, you shouldn't ask.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"--It's our position that if we need to bring in another lawyer with litigating responsibility and that lawyer has to learn matters occurring before the grand jury, we need a 6(e) order to do that.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Well now, that happened in this case, as I understand it, according to a letter to the Clerk of this Court, without a court order.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Something a little different from that happened in this case.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"At the end of the grand jury... excuse me.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"At the end of the civil investigation, a memorandum prepared by the two attorneys who had conducted the grand jury and who also conducted the civil investigation was forwarded to the various personnel in the Department who had supervisory responsibility for these two people and this litigation.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Most of those personnel were the same people occupying the same positions as they had occupied during the criminal phase, and they had been within the circle, so to speak, during the grand jury investigation stage of the proceedings.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Two of those people were new replacement people.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The Antitrust Division considered whether it needed a 6(e) order for disclosure to those people and concluded that it did not, the theory being that when the litigating attorneys have proper access to grand jury materials they should be able to report to the senior supervisory personnel in the Department, who have no litigating responsibility but reviewing responsibility for lots of cases, without obtaining a 6(e) order, because otherwise every time we change Attorney Generals or Assistant Attorneys General we'll have to go to court and get a whole lot of what should then be routine 6(e) orders.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Do you defend that position here in the face of Sells Engineering?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"I think that it raises a special question that the Court need not reach in this case.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The question that we brought before the Court is whether the same people, the litigating attorneys, may continue to have access to the grand jury materials.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In this case, there were two further disclosures, which were not considered by the court below.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"I might add that I think that they were palpably harmless both to the public interest and to the defendants.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But I suggest that, if there is to be a challenge to those two further disclosures, it ought to be initiated below.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"If the Court were to rule that we can't make those further disclosures to senior supervisory personnel, we will live with that.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"That's not a terribly important problem for us.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"I might come back to the subject of documents and just make clear one thing.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"After the grand jury investigation was terminated in this case, the Antitrust Division issued proper civil investigative demands under the Antitrust Civil Process Act.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The Respondents reserved all their rights, but told us, one formally and two informally, that we already had the documents under the civil investigative demands.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"We believe that we now hold all of the documents that we hold pursuant to proper CID's and not pursuant to grand jury subpoena at all.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"But did they formally respond by identifying the documents in response to the CID?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"At least two of them I think did not.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, all three said, we have previously supplied all of the documents covered by the CID.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Do you think that's an adequate response to the statutory demand?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"We accepted it under the circumstances.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Formally, on the record?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Well--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Does the record disclose there's been full compliance with the CID's, in other words, full responses to them?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"--We issued CID's that we considered were valid.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"I understand.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"We issued them saying to the Respondents, you may respond by indicating that you have previously supplied documents that are covered by this CID.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And all three of the Respondents did that, and I believe that we wrote them back acknowledging that.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"One of the Respondents did it formally, saying, we are complying and what we understand is happening is that, instead of your shipping our documents back to us at the end of the grand jury and our making them available a second time, we are simply leaving them with you.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The other two interposed various--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"What I have in mind--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown

the terms of the statute well enough, but say you serve an interrogatory, you're entitled to a sworn answer that so and so is the case.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"When you serve a CID, aren't you entitled to some kind of a sworn response that there's been a complete delivery of everything demanded?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And do you accept a phone call from a lawyer saying, you've got it all, as sufficient?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Unknown Speaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Not a phone call.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"We are entitled... we are entitled to a certificate.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"We in this instance accepted letters.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"We got a certificate from one and accepted letters from the other two saying, you have all the documents that you've asked for.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The other point I wanted to make under this head is that the problems that could arise during discovery and trial are, we suggest, problems that not only may, but must, be left to be dealt with in particularized 6(e) proceedings or other appropriate proceedings in the court where the civil case is pending.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"They cannot be solved by requiring the government attorneys to obtain a threshold 6(e) order giving them access to their own materials, because that order would not in any event authorize them to make disclosure to any other person.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Let me spend a moment in the second question in this case.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"We did seek and obtain a 6(e) order for purposes of conferring with the Civil Division about whether it would be appropriate to bring a 6(e)... excuse me... to bring a False Claims Act case here.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The Court of Appeals vacated that order on the ground that we could not possibly show particularized need because we had the Antitrust Civil Process Act and, although it might be hard to do so, we could duplicate all that testimony.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"It said that may be expensive and it may take some time, but the Supreme Court has told us in Sells that time and expense can play no part in our analysis.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"We think that was just a straightforward and obvious error.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"We accept the proposition that we may not have a 6(e) order solely in order to save time and expense.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But that's quite a different proposition from saying that time and expense drop entirely out of the equation, so that, even in a situation where, as here, the time and expense are prohibitive in relation to the use that we want to put the materials, we are denied a 6(e) order and therefore the ability to consult.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"I'd like to save my remaining time for rebuttal.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
