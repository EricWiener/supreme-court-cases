So what that means is that if you take somebody to a fancy lunch with a -- I can't remember the name of the bottle of wine you mentioned, Justice Breyer, but if you took them to that fancy lunch to thank them for referring you to a meeting with a mid-level staffer, even if there was no suggestion at all that you were going to do anything other than call that staffer and say, hey, can you take a meeting with this guy, hear him out, and exercise your independent judgment, that would be a violation of the Federal gratuity statute. And, indeed, under the government's broad theory that anything within the range of official duties counts, that means that if you took the person out to that lunch as thanks for giving you a tour of the Capitol Building, you would likewise have violated the Federal gratuity statute, because there, there is no quid pro quo requirement at all.
