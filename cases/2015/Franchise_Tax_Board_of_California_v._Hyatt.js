When this Court opened up the possibility of just such a judgment by allowing Chisholm, a South Carolina citizen, to sue the sovereign State of Georgia in this Court, the nation quickly and emphatically reacted with the Eleventh Amendment that eliminated the possibility of such a suit even in this most neutral of Federal forums.
