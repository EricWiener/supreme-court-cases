So I'll end with this: What does that tell you? The fact that you look at these disability cases and you see that money is being advanced and it's being spent before the lien even attaches, and yet they're made part of the circuit split, and in this case Respondent is not willing to defend that as a policy position, I think what it tells you is that fair-minded people could disagree as to where you want to place the risk. And so when we go and look at this and we think about it in terms of burdens, if there is any reasonable position, as you look at this, that a rule that says you can essentially go after general assets, means that some meaningful number of fiduciaries will abuse that to assert rights they don't have or to delay, then I think you need to go with the clear line of historical authorities.
