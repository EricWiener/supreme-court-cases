filed suit against Skelly asking damages, money damages for a breach of the expressed and implied governance of the lease.","start":99.298,"stop":115.146,"duration":15.85},{"text":"And notified the United States, invited them to come into the lawsuit.","start":115.146,"stop":122.43,"duration":7.28},{"text":"They did not elect to come into the case.","start":122.43,"stop":127.663,"duration":5.23},{"text":"A trial course sustained a demurrer which is comparable to the motion to dismiss federal practice and it would appeal to the Supreme Court in the State of Oklahoma.","start":127.663,"stop":141.944,"duration":14.28},{"text":"The Supreme Court in the State of Oklahoma held by reason of the federal restrictions against alienation.","start":141.944,"stop":152.539,"duration":10.6},{"text":"These Indian lessor do not have the capacity to bring a suit for damage.","start":152.539,"stop":165.178,"duration":12.64},{"text":"After the Supreme Court had so held by appropriate proceedings, we filed an application for a certiorari which was granted by this Court.","start":165.178,"stop":178.41,"duration":13.23},{"text":"The United States at the invitation of the Court, I have filed a brief amicus curiae and the United States supports our position.","start":178.41,"stop":191.256,"duration":12.85},{"text":"So simply stated it is our position, the only one question here is whether Indian lessors in a departmental oil and gas lease have the capacity to institute and maintain a suit for damages without the joiner the of the United States.","start":191.256,"stop":223.203,"duration":31.95},{"text":"Now, there is no question that the United States had a perfect right to bring such a lawsuit.","start":223.203,"stop":230.786,"duration":7.58},{"text":"It's our position the Indian lessors have their right to bring such a lawsuit.","start":230.786,"stop":239.449,"duration":8.66},{"text":"The case is here as the Court please, on a question of the pleadings that ended demurrer was sustained.","start":239.449,"stop":247.502,"duration":8.05},{"text":"All the allegations of our petition must be taken as proof.","start":247.502,"stop":254.961,"duration":7.46},{"text":"In other words, we think we should be permitted to bring a lawsuit for damages.","start":254.961,"stop":266.97,"duration":12.01},{"text":"It is our theory that the restrictions against alienation are for the protection of the Indians.","start":266.97,"stop":281.321,"duration":14.35},{"text":"That the United States will not permit certain Indian citizens the right to alienate their lands but that restriction if Your Honor please, goes to the same to the alienation of the property.","start":281.321,"stop":307.468,"duration":26.15},{"text":"It is our position and we submit that it was never the intention of the Congress that an oil and gas lessee such as the respondent in this case would be entitled to benefit by using these restrictions against the Indian and saying that the Indian does not have the right to bring a lawsuit to recover what he thinks he is entitled to receive by reason of a breach of the lease contract.","start":307.468,"stop":351.349,"duration":43.88}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Supposing you prevail on this

number of different matters as we point that out in our briefs.","start":388.462,"stop":398.618,"duration":10.16},{"text":"But I do not believe if I may say, if Your Honor please, I do not believe that that is the determining test.","start":398.618,"stop":411.293,"duration":12.68},{"text":"The test in this case, if the Court please, is whether or not there has been an intended sale or alienation of the property that is when the federal restriction applied.","start":411.293,"stop":430.788,"duration":19.5},{"text":"Now, and we pointed out in our briefs.","start":430.788,"stop":434.511,"duration":3.72},{"text":"There are some language in the early decision, the Heckman case that of this Court, that indicates clearly that the -- a member of the five civilized tribes or the United States Government could bring a lawsuit pertaining to a departmental oil and gas lease.","start":434.511,"stop":462.48,"duration":27.97},{"text":"Some time after that in the Tenth Circuit, there was a case Seitz versus Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations.","start":462.48,"stop":475.5,"duration":13.02},{"text":"In that case reviews of all the authorities were set out in that opinion that is referred to in our brief.","start":475.5,"stop":484.722,"duration":9.22},{"text":"And the Tenth -- and the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, squarely held that either the Indian or the Indian Tribe or the United States could bring such a lawsuit as we seek the right to bring it here.","start":484.722,"stop":508.395,"duration":23.67},{"text":"Now, it is quite clear that the opinion of the state court in this case based to its decision solely on the question of these restrictions prevented the Indian from bringing this suit.","start":508.395,"stop":533.743,"duration":25.35},{"text":"Skelly Oil Company may have raised two or three, other what I think, at least to be interesting question.","start":533.743,"stop":544.015,"duration":10.27},{"text":"One question they raise is they say the Supreme Court of Oklahoma could have decided this case on grounds other than what they did decided on.","start":544.015,"stop":557.037,"duration":13.02},{"text":"I do not think that is the inquiry here.","start":557.037,"stop":562.861,"duration":5.82},{"text":"I think that when the opinion of the States' Supreme Court squarely basing it this decision on federal regulations, federal laws then it is our position that this Court has jurisdiction to determine whether or not such a decision were sound or unsound.","start":562.861,"stop":592.64,"duration":29.78},{"text":"There is another interesting matter, at least to me, that while the case was in the Supreme Court, Skelly Oil Company filed a motion to dismiss.","start":592.64,"stop":606.356,"duration":13.72},{"text":"The motion to dismiss were denied to dismiss the appeal.","start":606.356,"stop":612.99,"duration":6.63},{"text":"However, in denying the appeal, the Supreme Court stated that in the future a different rule would apply.","start":612.99,"stop":627.137,"duration":14.15},{"text":"In other words, Skelly Oil Company has argued that because a motion to dismiss was denied by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma their lives have been offended under the Federal Constitution because they have been denied to equal protection of the law.","start":627.137,"stop":647.112,"duration":19.98},{"text":"Now, this Court in the Great Northern case that I have said had passed squarely on that question.","start":647.112,"stop":657.765,"duration":10.65},{"text":"That was an interesting case, if Your Honor may please the state court in Montana have ruled and adjudicated the question about tariffs in a previous decision known as the Donnie case when the merit came up to the Supreme Court again in the Great Northern case.","start":657.765,"stop":687.084,"duration":29.32},{"text":"The Supreme Court of Montana said, “We're going to overrule the Donnie case.","start":687.084,"stop":692.723,"duration":5.64},{"text":"But we're going to apply the rule in the Donnie case to the Great Northern Case and that our ruling here is only prospective.","start":692.723,"stop":703.45,"duration":10.73},{"text":"This Court in that case held that such a decision did not offend the rights of the Great Northern under the Federal Constitution.","start":703.45,"stop":717.556,"duration":14.11},{"text":"And it's interesting that the Oklahoma Court in writing its opinion on the motion to dismiss followed the Great Northern decision.","start":717.556,"stop":731.715,"duration":14.16},{"text":"I have referred to reserve the balance of my time Your

now.","start":736.09,"stop":746.484,"duration":10.39}]},{"speakerName":"John H. Cantrell","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice and may the Court please.","start":746.484,"stop":752.7,"duration":6.22},{"text":"This case contains a much deeper involvement and that indicated by state friend who has proceeding being at this electorate.","start":752.7,"stop":769.65,"duration":16.95},{"text":"As will be indicated I hope by the very brief time which I have to state its various ramifications.","start":769.65,"stop":779.283,"duration":9.63},{"text":"I do believe by way of preliminary that the opinion and decision of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma is much broader in scope and deeper in depths than that indicated by my friend.","start":779.283,"stop":801.722,"duration":22.44},{"text":"In addition to that, I do believe also that under many previous decisions of this Court, I may present to this Court with proprietary matters concerning which the Supreme Court of Oklahoma did not speak consistent with the decree or the decision which was entered.","start":801.722,"stop":831.614,"duration":29.89},{"text":"If the matters were there presented and either erroneously decided or ignored and for that I have no less authority than the language of Mr. Justice Cardozo in Morley Construction Company against Maryland Casualty Company, 300 U.S.185 and 191 which I would briefly refer without a cross appeal.","start":831.614,"stop":860.266,"duration":28.65},{"text":"An appellee may urge and support of a decree any matter appearing in the record.","start":860.266,"stop":868.55,"duration":8.28},{"text":"Although his argument may involve and attack upon the reasoning of the lower court or an insistence upon matter overlooked or ignored by it.","start":868.55,"stop":883.018,"duration":14.47},{"text":"So with that in mind, I think I have just found an outlining to Your Honors the various points which are necessarily involved in a proper decision of the issues in this Court.","start":883.018,"stop":897.672,"duration":14.65},{"text":"Initially, a feel I may say with propriety that I regret and even deplore the suggestion contained in some of the briefs that the decision of the two courts in Oklahoma contrary to the claims of the Indians were the result of racial discrimination.","start":897.672,"stop":922.383,"duration":24.71},{"text":"I believe that the record will indicate beyond per adventure of a doubt that that is not so.","start":922.383,"stop":929.759,"duration":7.38},{"text":"That the doors of the courts were not closed to these Indians and that they had every possible proper consideration are their cause under the procedures of a forum deliberately chosen by the petitioners for the advancement in their cause.","start":929.759,"stop":955.394,"duration":25.63},{"text":"And in that connection I think it is quite proper also to indicate here very briefly and it is covered in the brief more fully, that upon the matter of what the issues were and what kind of a case it was the petitioners were seeking to present, the petitioners made to the trial court a deliberate election of choice of the kind of an action they wish to pursue.","start":955.394,"stop":982.188,"duration":26.79},{"text":"And said to the trial court, “If you will not require us to elect between the two different types of actions which might have been wrong, we will state to Your Honor that hereafter this will be treated solely as an action upon the contract to recover royalties due to the petitioners under the terms of the Department of Lease.”","start":982.188,"stop":1010.211,"duration":28.02},{"text":"Now, I say that to Your Honors by way of preliminary because while it is not been definitely stated here in argument, it is clear from the greatest which have been filed and the position of the petitioners below that their theories of their right to maintain this action to successful conclusion are predicated upon the decision of this Court.","start":1010.211,"stop":1035.974,"duration":25.76},{"text":"In Heckman versus United States in the 212 U.S. 412, 224 U.S. 412, and upon an Act of Congress which as I recall is referred to as the Hasting Act in 1926, applicable only and solely as specifically to the five civilized tribes of which of course the Comanches are not among the number.","start":1035.974,"stop":1066.9,"duration":30.93},{"text":"The Heckman case is not authority for the maintenance of this action to successful conclusion because the Heckman case contrary to counsel's statement did not involve an attempt to recover upon a departmental lease.","start":1066.9,"stop":1084.422,"duration":17.52},{"text":"But involved in action by the United States itself or the cancellation of numerous and as I recall running into thousands are Cherokee restricted Indian's deeds attempting to convey their allotments contrary to the restrictions imposed by Congress and extended by the congressional enactment of 1906.","start":1084.422,"stop":1113.775,"duration":29.35},{"text":"The holding in that case after reviewing the treaties with the Cherokees, the holding in that case, a very extensive opinion, was boil down to its ultimate statement that the United States being the guardian of the Indians and the five civilized tribes owe the duty to prosecute upon the behalf of the individual members of those tribes actions to recover interest in their lands.","start":1113.775,"stop":1148.202,"duration":34.43},{"text":"And then by way of what I shall refer to as considered victim because I wouldn't wipe and decide or attempt to believe with it.","start":1148.202,"stop":1157.597,"duration":9.39},{"text":"This Court said in that connection, of course the Indian may bring his own action to recover his interest in tribal lands and if the United States wish to take over the action, it could do so.","start":1157.597,"stop":1179.78,"duration":22.18},{"text":"And following that, there has been some little use of that victim in cases that are entirely different from this one.","start":1179.78,"stop":1189.941,"duration":10.16},{"text":"And I may say to Your Honors that, under the law which is applicable to this particular kind of case both under the procedures adopted under the code of procedural Oklahoma and the federal statutes and the federal decisions.","start":1189.941,"stop":1207.296,"duration":17.36},{"text":"There cannot be a successful recovery by the Indians in this Court.","start":1207.296,"stop":1215.211,"duration":7.91},{"text":"Now, Your Honors I would like to have you bare with me a moment while I indicate to you what I consider to be a distinction between an action brought under the Court in Oklahoma to recover an interest or to protect an interest in the lands and an action like this one which is brought to recover alleged royalties due by way of damages or otherwise under and because of the terms of the departmental lease.","start":1215.211,"stop":1247.858,"duration":32.65},{"text":"There was no departmental lease involved in the Heckman case.","start":1247.858,"stop":1252.558,"duration":4.7},{"text":"The other statutory provision to which reference has been made as first seen possibly some indication of authority for the Indians to maintain this suit to successful conclusion is as I indicated the Act of 1926, which itself is specifically limited in its effect to lands and the civilized tribes and of course by his very language is not applicable to these Comanches.","start":1252.558,"stop":1281.568,"duration":29.01},{"text":"And could not be extended in my judgment by judicial fiat beyond that which the Congress clearly intended to accomplish and that was to provide a remedy for the Indians and the five civilized tribes to the exclusion of the United States if it refused to come into the action.","start":1281.568,"stop":1302.861,"duration":21.29},{"text":"That's what that act provide for.","start":1302.861,"stop":1305.929,"duration":3.07},{"text":"So that it is not applicable to this situation and we go to the Supreme Court of Oklahoma with a decision and decree of the District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma limited by virtue of venue provisions of the Oklahoma statutes to a cause of action based upon the contract to recover might as do honor it.","start":1305.929,"stop":1330.961,"duration":25.03},{"text":"That was the nature of this action and that's the sole nature of this action.","start":1330.961,"stop":1333,"duration":2.04},{"text":"And that's the only kind of an action that the Oklahoma County District Court could have tried or the Supreme Court could have reviewed.","start":1333,"stop":1343.182,"duration":10.18},{"text":"The cause of action to recover are established an interest in the lands themselves or their profits or their royalties or their underlying mineral areas had to be instituted if it all in the state courts of Oklahoma in Stevens County, Oklahoma where the land lies.","start":1343.182,"stop":1362.509,"duration":19.33},{"text":"So

it.","start":1564.95,"stop":1587.902,"duration":22.95},{"text":"In it there is reference to these rules and regulations and the lessee and the lessors are required by the terms of the lease and to
