Hayes","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.","start":42.662,"stop":50.344,"duration":7.68},{"text":"We are concerned here with the case of Hanover, a manufacturer of men's shoes brought against the defendant, United for damages occasioned by United's monopolization of the shoe machinery trade.","start":50.344,"stop":74.324,"duration":23.98},{"text":"Hanover leased from United all of the machines involved in this case at least which is needed in the manufacture of its shoes.","start":74.324,"stop":88.439,"duration":14.11},{"text":"There were no comp -- machines, comparable in quality with the United's machines which were available from any other domestic or foreign source.","start":88.439,"stop":102.808,"duration":14.37},{"text":"The District Court undisturbed by the Court of Appeals found that United's monopoly position was from 89% to 100% of the 20 most important machines which accounted for 80% of the royalties which Hanover paid United, and it's monopoly position was from 85% to 100% of all but six of the machines and there were a total of 58 which Hanover rented from United.","start":102.808,"stop":140.566,"duration":37.76},{"text":"Now, all of those machine types were available to Hanover from United solely on a lease only basis.","start":140.566,"stop":151.752,"duration":11.19},{"text":"In 1947, the government brought an action against United and I shall refer to that action as the government action.","start":151.752,"stop":165.43,"duration":13.68},{"text":"In that action, the District Court held that United's lease only policy, the provisions of its leases and related sales policies or related policies having to do with its relations with its customers were exclusionary and illegal.","start":165.43,"stop":188.114,"duration":22.68},{"text":"And it held on the basis of its findings that United had monopolized the shoe machinery trade.","start":188.114,"stop":196.748,"duration":8.63},{"text":"Now, in the course of this argument I am going to use the shorthand phrase, leasing system to describe the leases and the bundle of policies which were condemned by the District Court in the government action.","start":196.748,"stop":213.848,"duration":17.1},{"text":"On the basis of its decision, the Court in the government action enjoined the leasing system and directed that, from the date to be fixed, United should offer no machine of those involved for lease unless it also offered it for sale.","start":213.848,"stop":242.783,"duration":28.93},{"text":"The decision of the District Court in the government's action as Your Honors well know was affirmed by this Court in a per curiam decision.","start":242.783,"stop":256.362,"duration":13.58},{"text":"The decree in the government action was offered and received in evidence by the District Court below.","start":256.362,"stop":264.596,"duration":8.23},{"text":"The District Court below in arriving at its findings and conclusions relied on that decree on the findings and conclusions of the Court in the government action and also an additional proof of monopolization which Hanover offered at the trial.","start":264.596,"stop":285.085,"duration":20.49},{"text":"With respect to damages, Hanover offered two kinds of proof.","start":285.085,"stop":292.991,"duration":7.91},{"text":"It's first kind of proof what the District Court refers to as a primary claim, consisted of a comparison between the rentals which United actually -- I mean, which Hanover, pardon me, actually paid to United and what it would have cost Hanover if it had owned the machines and met the necessary ownership cost, that was one method.","start":292.991,"stop":324.439,"duration":31.45},{"text":"The second method was based on 19 instances which we found in the evidence in the record in the government action, instances where United had reduced its rents and royalties on machines when it was faced with competition, with respect to those machines and I might mention though that a matter purely of interest that the percentage reductions ranged from 11% to 82% and averaged out at 43%.","start":324.439,"stop":364.3,"duration":39.86},{"text":"The District Court held that with respect to that evidence which was tendered to show excessiveness in the rents and royalties themselves, the plaintiff, Hanover had failed to prove excessiveness.","start":364.3,"stop":380.636,"duration":16.34},{"text":"United in its briefs consistently asserts that its rents and royalties have been held reasonable.","start":380.636,"stop":389.902,"duration":9.27},{"text":"There is no such holding by the District Court in this case or by the District Court in the government action.","start":389.902,"stop":397.201,"duration":7.3},{"text":"The holding was that Hanover failed to prove excessiveness which is somewhat different.","start":397.201,"stop":405.314,"duration":8.11},{"text":"The District Court, however, in this action found that under Hanover's primary proof, the comparison of leasing with ownership cost, Hanover had demonstrated that it had been damaged in the sum of $1,413,000.","start":405.314,"stop":425.212,"duration":19.9},{"text":"That is what had cost Hanover to lease the machines over and above what it would have cost Hanover if it have had the opportunity in a free market to buy the machines.","start":425.212,"stop":438.573,"duration":13.36},{"text":"On United's appeal to the Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, that Court affirmed with respect to all claims, all questions having to do with liability.","start":438.573,"stop":454.624,"duration":16.05},{"text":"And United's appeal to that Court presented every question that's involved in the conditional cross petition here.","start":454.624,"stop":465.193,"duration":10.57},{"text":"It did, however, order a new trial, limited to damages on two grounds.","start":465.193,"stop":473.242,"duration":8.05},{"text":"The first of these grounds is that the award of damages should be reduced by the so called tax benefits, tax disadvantages that ownership would entail to it as I understand the opinion that if Hanover had been the owner, it would not have had the advantage, it did have as lessee in that as lessee.","start":473.242,"stop":504.85,"duration":31.61},{"text":"It was able to deduct all its rents and royalties on its tax returns.","start":504.85,"stop":511.746,"duration":6.9},{"text":"And also that as owner, Hanover would have had to pay capital gains taxes on any machines itself.","start":511.746,"stop":523.017,"duration":11.27},{"text":"Now it's strange to my poor simple mind as the Court of Appeals decision is with respect to the deduction of the expenses.","start":523.017,"stop":532.022,"duration":9},{"text":"It loses me completely with respect to the capital gains because as I will mention in a moment the reason is that Hanover must be assumed to have had a choice and you calculate the damages as they would have been calculated if Hanover had a choice, but assuming Hanover had choice, how Hanover in deciding to buy the machine could tell when and what amount it would have a capital gain completely escapes me.","start":532.022,"stop":563.634,"duration":31.61},{"text":"There is no evidence in the record that if Hanover had purchased machines, it would have sold them before the end of their useful lives or that if it did sell them, it would have sold them for more than the depreciated value on the books of Hanover.","start":563.634,"stop":582.017,"duration":18.38},{"text":"Now this we submit, this holding of the Court of Appeals with respect to so called tax advantages that Hanover enjoyed under the leasing system is error.","start":582.017,"stop":594.937,"duration":12.92},{"text":"We start from one basic fundamental principle that there is no law, that we have been able to discover and no basis in fact in this case why Hanover should be treated any differently from any other treble-damage plaintiff.","start":594.937,"stop":619.785,"duration":24.85},{"text":"Such plaintiffs always are permitted to recover the full damage sustained by them without regard to tax consequences.","start":619.785,"stop":629.725,"duration":9.94},{"text":"We haven't found a single case which could see the so called tax consequences, may be cover the excess.","start":629.725,"stop":637.904,"duration":8.18},{"text":"The excess here was the amount by which the leasing cost exceeded what would have been the ownership cost.","start":637.904,"stop":648.721,"duration":10.82},{"text":"Our calculations as such are not challenged.","start":648.721,"stop":654.035,"duration":5.31},{"text":"There is one challenge that Mr. Carson makes that I will come to, but the Courts below did not challenge them.","start":654.035,"stop":658.854,"duration":4.82},{"text":"What the Court of Appeals did in the District Court we submit was correct in its oppose to this case was to disregard what has been traditionally the basic rule of damages that in approaching damages, courts do not go beyond the first step and this is a rule that has been recognized constantly over the years, in both contracts and torts cases.","start":658.854,"stop":689.975,"duration":31.12},{"text":"Now the Court of Appeals' reasoning --","start":689.975,"stop":691.118,"duration":1.14}]},{"speakerName":"Potter

considered.","start":711.7,"stop":715.099,"duration":3.4},{"text":"That is as I understand the meaning of the rule, Mr. Justice Stewart.","start":715.099,"stop":720.536,"duration":5.44},{"text":"The Court of Appeals' reasoning here is rather than intriguing.","start":720.536,"stop":724.49,"duration":3.95},{"text":"They begin with the finding below, well supported by the evidence that if Hanover had had the opportunity, it would have bought the machines.","start":724.49,"stop":733.852,"duration":9.36},{"text":"And then they do -- they went to a bit of vaticination.","start":733.852,"stop":739.248,"duration":5.4},{"text":"They say now if Hanover had been free to choose, what happened?","start":739.248,"stop":746.2,"duration":6.95},{"text":"It would like every other businessman have weighed the two courses open to it, leasing and owning.","start":746.2,"stop":758.242,"duration":12.04},{"text":"And that business has been generally when weighing such choices, consider not merely the gross but the net, they consider the tax consequences that might be involved in either choice.","start":758.242,"stop":771.633,"duration":13.39},{"text":"And accordingly, since businessmen would normally consider the tax consequences, as if the tax consequences looked upon by businessmen would be inherent in their choice, damages should be calculated in the same fashion as the decision whether to buy or sell by looking prospectively, retrospectively, prospectively at tax consequences.","start":771.633,"stop":800.015,"duration":28.38},{"text":"Now to begin with, I mentioned the Court of Appeals and United has mentioned of the so called tax (Inaudible).","start":800.015,"stop":810.111,"duration":10.1},{"text":"Under the law, they are non existent.","start":810.111,"stop":814.514,"duration":4.4},{"text":"All expenses of leasing, all expenses of ownership are fully deductible on taxpayer's tax returns.","start":814.514,"stop":831.08,"duration":16.57},{"text":"The error of the Court of Appeals here aside from going beyond the first step, the error inherent in this choice reasoning of theirs is their assumption that the elements which are considered by businessmen in deciding whether or not they will take a certain business step are the elements that must be considered by courts in deciding or rather in calculating the amount of the damage sustained by an injured plaintiff.","start":831.08,"stop":865.546,"duration":34.47},{"text":"That is a necessary part of their error.","start":865.546,"stop":871.61,"duration":6.06},{"text":"And even this talk of choice to my again, poor, simple mind is beyond the point.","start":871.61,"stop":882.109,"duration":10.5},{"text":"Hanover had no choice.","start":882.109,"stop":885.497,"duration":3.39},{"text":"Hanover, we have demonstrated, was compelled by monopolization to pay out more money for the operation of its business than it would have paid would not -- would have paid in a free market and they were forced to pay it out because they operated in a monopolized market.","start":885.497,"stop":905.595,"duration":20.1},{"text":"If in fact Hanover had a choice, it could have been bought or leased, we will have no claim.","start":905.595,"stop":914.243,"duration":8.65},{"text":"That would be nonexistent.","start":914.243,"stop":915.633,"duration":1.39},{"text":"It was the lack of choice by which Hanover was injured.","start":915.633,"stop":920.996,"duration":5.36},{"text":"And what Hanover might have done or Hanover might have considered, assuming it had a choice or would any other businessman might or might not have considered, we submit is of utmost of academic interest and would have nothing to do with the question as what was the amount of the damage to Hanover.","start":920.996,"stop":946.708,"duration":25.71},{"text":"Now, it is not at all surprising that the Court of Appeals cited no authority, non exists which it could cite.","start":946.708,"stop":957.067,"duration":10.36},{"text":"The nearest approach to an authority with the sort of reasoning it gives, it said, it's just as realistic to deduct taxes as it was for the District Court to require that in calculating the damages, the servicing expenses on the machines should be deducted.","start":957.067,"stop":981.482,"duration":24.41},{"text":"It is an equation that I am afraid escapes me.","start":981.482,"stop":985.226,"duration":3.74},{"text":"It is a new part of my talking criminal matters but I am addressing myself to the Court of Appeals' comment.","start":985.226,"stop":993.146,"duration":7.92},{"text":"Servicing expenses quite obviously of expenses of operation that are met and paid before whenever reaches net profit.","start":993.146,"stop":1004.627,"duration":11.48},{"text":"Taxes have nothing to do as such with the operation of a business.","start":1004.627,"stop":1009.681,"duration":5.05},{"text":"They are a sharing on the part of the taxpayer with the sovereign of what the taxpayer has left after he has arrived at his net profit.","start":1009.681,"stop":1022.941,"duration":13.26},{"text":"Now in no sense as United would suggest any very noble or unique case.","start":1022.941,"stop":1030.882,"duration":7.94},{"text":"It's not the first time that plaintiffs in antitrust actions have been damaged by being forced to incur greater cost because of an antitrust violation than they would have incurred absent the violation and it very likely that in every such case, the injured plaintiffs deducted those excess costs on their tax returns because there are operations of a business, but it was never been suggested that I can find that such plaintiffs should not recover the full amount of the excess cost or that the excess cost should have been deducted from them the taxes they saved because they deducted the excess cost on their tax returns.","start":1030.882,"stop":1076.049,"duration":45.17},{"text":"This is what is novel.","start":1076.049,"stop":1078.171,"duration":2.12},{"text":"There is no case in the books which even suggests it.","start":1078.171,"stop":1083.971,"duration":5.8},{"text":"I beg your pardon, Your Honors.","start":1083.971,"stop":1087.082,"duration":3.11},{"text":"The damage sustained by it, if I may paraphrase the statute, was the full excess extracted from Hanover by United through its monopolization.","start":1087.082,"stop":1103.603,"duration":16.52},{"text":"Now, one purpose of damages is to put the parties back in the positions they would have occupied if there had never been a violation.","start":1103.603,"stop":1112.484,"duration":8.88},{"text":"In the examples in our briefs, we have demonstrated that by disregarding the Court of Appeals rule, forgetting this choice business and tax business, the parties are put back where they were.","start":1112.484,"stop":1131.161,"duration":18.68},{"text":"But by taking the Court of Appeals rule and applying it, using a 50% assumed tax rate, the result is that the United, the monopolizer, the violator is left with half of the unlawful exaction and the victim, Hanover is out of pocket the same amount of money.","start":1131.161,"stop":1157.324,"duration":26.16},{"text":"We submit that an approach which leaves the wrong doer with his illegal games and the victim out of profit could not possibly come under the heading of a symbol on the top of the entrance to this Courthouse.","start":1157.324,"stop":1180.839,"duration":23.51},{"text":"Now the second ground upon which the Court of Appeals ordered a new trial was that the damage period should be cut almost halfway through its full statutory distance because of the view of the Court of Appeals that the decision of this Court on June 10, 1946, an American Tobacco case brought about a change in the law and so the Court of Appeals would cut off Hanover's damages at that point.","start":1180.839,"stop":1226.525,"duration":45.69},{"text":"United goes much further in its brief.","start":1226.525,"stop":1230.113,"duration":3.59}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"How long was the cut

463, looks upon the Court of Appeals which is a defense but as a secondary position, United's primary position is that the decree in the government action can be given no retroactive effect whatsoever.","start":1247.591,"stop":1269.298,"duration":21.71},{"text":"It must be considered solely, prospectively according to the United, there should be no award here but if there is going to be an award at least begins the damage period at June 10, 1946.","start":1269.298,"stop":1286.242,"duration":16.94},{"text":"Now, if I may address myself for a moment first to United's position, we can find no authority, no principle, and the whole history of the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, legislative history, cases which supports United's position that a decree in a government action shall be looked upon prospectively only.","start":1286.242,"stop":1316.187,"duration":29.94},{"text":"And here again, we submit that Hanover should not be treated any differently from the way any other antitrust plaintiff is treated, as the main antitrust plaintiff who relies on a decree in a prior government case.","start":1316.187,"stop":1334.887,"duration":18.7},{"text":"All such government decrees and again, I apologize for stressing premier concepts, are based on the findings of the Court in the Government case and an adjudication of a violation of the law in the past or there would be no basis for the decree.","start":1334.887,"stop":1360.467,"duration":25.58},{"text":"And then the decree operates prospectively because it can't operate any other way as to action.","start":1360.467,"stop":1368.064,"duration":7.6},{"text":"It wipes out the illegal action or it wipes out the conduct, the illegal conduct in the future, but it cannot change the illegal conduct that it found to have existed in the past.","start":1368.064,"stop":1382.321,"duration":14.26},{"text":"United's proposed rule is very interesting one so far as further damage and plaintiffs are concerned and treble-damage plaintiffs have a hard enough time as it is proving their cases.","start":1382.321,"stop":1396.079,"duration":13.76},{"text":"But per United's rule, there would never be an occasion on the statutory provision that the decree in the government action is prima facie evidence would ever be possible at all, because if decrees operate prospectively, they would contain no adjudication as to the past.","start":1396.079,"stop":1423.354,"duration":27.28},{"text":"Now the fact is that the evidence of a government action covers many years going back to before the 1920's
