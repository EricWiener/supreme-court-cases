mercy -- with mercy, the sentencing judge provided that nine of the sentences would be served concurrently with the other 10 which would be served consecutively so that he was sentenced for this refusal to answer on the base of this one short conversation with sentence to 10 years in prison.","start":271.518,"stop":300.472,"duration":28.95},{"text":"The Appellate Division affirmed the conviction but modified the judgement by reducing the sentence to one year stating that irrespective of whether he had been guilty of one crime or 19 crimes or any amount in
