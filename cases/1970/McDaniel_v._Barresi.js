of the schools.","start":917.743,"stop":950.128,"duration":32.38},{"text":"Now, we in Clarke County have frankly, we have gerrymandered zone not to achieve, not to retain segregation, but to try to do just the opposite, to try to make some in the schools, to avoid the entanglements that were consequent upon maintaining a segregated system.","start":950.128,"stop":976.666,"duration":26.54},{"text":"We obviously had dual system prior to 1954.","start":976.666,"stop":982.551,"duration":5.88},{"text":"We begin the process of
