had been represented by counsel for Furness, Withy petitioned the Federal Maritime Commission and its own name of the point being that they regarded themselves as having been in the case up until that

Boston.","start":818.768,"stop":859.314,"duration":40.55},{"text":"The Federal District Court heard the parties on a stipulation of all the facts including the Federal Maritime Commission's decision

and claim normal rights of appeal if it wanted to get into these issues which were presented.","start":869.981,"stop":885.177,"duration":15.2},{"text":"And second, even if this Court were to review it, meaning the Federal District Court, we would reach the same result that the Federal Maritime Commission did and for reasons that are amply set forth in the Commission's decision itself and therefore, the District Court entered an order of judgment against all of the defendants including Transatlantic.","start":885.177,"stop":915.201,"duration":30.02},{"text":"Transatlantic only appealed -- Transatlantic appealed to the First Circuit Court of Appeals and want a reversal.","start":915.201,"stop":924.225,"duration":9.02},{"text":"And the First Circuit Court of Appeals held first on the res judicata issue, they want a party and as a party they went bound by the FMC's decision.","start":924.225,"stop":935.282,"duration":11.06},{"text":"And second, the United States Supreme Court in the Volkswagenwerk case took an expanded reading of Section 15 and under that expanded reading, a number of cases seems to be authoritative which are collected in a footnote in the court's opinion on page 51 of the record appendix and these charges would become modifications of the original Section 15 agreement.","start":935.282,"stop":966.034,"duration":30.75},{"text":"Now that was the procedure in the case and the factual background is not complex.","start":966.034,"stop":975.076,"duration":9.04},{"text":"The factual background is this.","start":975.076,"stop":977.454,"duration":2.38},{"text":"In the Port of Boston, the terminals have organized under a Terminal Conference Agreement numbered 8785 and that Terminal Conference Agreement authorizes the members to issue a tariff to fix charges and rates on wharfage, demurrage, and other terminal services.","start":977.454,"stop":1001.568,"duration":24.11},{"text":"The exact language of the agreement is printed entirely in the record appendix.","start":1001.568,"stop":1010.887,"duration":9.32},{"text":"The following subject matters and all services, facilities rates, and charges incidental thereto: wharfage, dockage, free time wharf demurrage, usage charges, passenger charges, water and electricity.","start":1010.887,"stop":1024.595,"duration":13.71},{"text":"It was under that agreement that the members issued their tariff originally in 1962 amending it in 1964.","start":1024.595,"stop":1035.502,"duration":10.91},{"text":"The amendment of the tariff changed the charge for wharf demurrage over to the vessel in cases of longshoremen's strikes.","start":1035.502,"stop":1047.285,"duration":11.78},{"text":"When as a practical matter, the consignee can't get his cargo off the pier.","start":1047.285,"stop":1055.631,"duration":8.35},{"text":"That was a practical judgment of the terminals of something that was fair to do and they ought to do.","start":1055.631,"stop":1061.105,"duration":5.47},{"text":"They have nothing to do with bill collections or anything like that.","start":1061.105,"stop":1064.832,"duration":3.73},{"text":"They were charging people for wharf storage or wharf demurrage on cargo where the man physically could not get his truck in to pick off the cargo.","start":1064.832,"stop":1075.678,"duration":10.85},{"text":"And so they transferred it under the tariff to the vessel, where it was the longshoremen's strike and under the same provision in the tariff, if it's a terminal employee's strike and longshoremen are not employees of the terminals but if it is a terminal employee's strike that prevents removal then there is no charge to anybody.","start":1075.678,"stop":1095.5,"duration":19.82},{"text":"That was the practical situation that led up to this thorny administrative law of question.","start":1095.5,"stop":1104.112,"duration":8.61},{"text":"The question of the review by the District Court of this Federal Maritime Commission decision is one that can be easily answered from examination of the terms of the statutes.","start":1104.112,"stop":1123.016,"duration":18.9},{"text":"I don't see how the Administrative Order's Review Act could be clearer when it says, “Exclusive jurisdiction to review orders of the Federal Maritime Commission under section 830 of Chapter 46 is in the Court of Appeals.”","start":1123.016,"stop":1143.013,"duration":20},{"text":"If that's what it says, presumably that's what it means and I realized that my brother has made a talented argument to call ICC procedures into this case but in a nutshell the argument cannot carry the cases that he cites in particular won't support him.","start":1143.013,"stop":1166.984,"duration":23.97},{"text":"I think they're contradictory to his argument.","start":1166.984,"stop":1170.233,"duration":3.25},{"text":"The only one which I am going to mention before passing on to the Section 15 issue is Pennsylvania Railroad versus the United States in 363.","start":1170.233,"stop":1183.25,"duration":13.02},{"text":"In that case, the reference so called was the same kind of reference we had in this case.","start":1183.25,"stop":1190.47,"duration":7.22},{"text":"In that case the Court of Claims stayed the proceeding before it, which was a proceeding by the Pennsylvania Railroad against the United States stayed it.","start":1190.47,"stop":1201.796,"duration":11.33},{"text":"So the complaining party could go to the ICC, which the complaining party did and under the statutes governing that particular situation, the loser before the ICC would have a right to go to the District Court in the Interstate Commerce Commission situation.","start":1201.796,"stop":1222.509,"duration":20.71},{"text":"And this Court held that as a result, the Court of Claims had no review jurisdiction.","start":1222.509,"stop":1232.294,"duration":9.79},{"text":"It's a holding that is quite parallel to our situation and quite opposite to what my brother will argue.","start":1232.294,"stop":1240.422,"duration":8.13},{"text":"And moreover, the court pointed out there that where the ICC had reached the divided determination on the issue that is the railroad one on some of the issue and the U.S. as the shipper, one on some of the issue, would that happened the order was not merely advisory.","start":1240.422,"stop":1263.342,"duration":22.92},{"text":"The order was just as final as it could be and it was in this case.","start":1263.342,"stop":1267.403,"duration":4.06},{"text":"It was nothing more that could be done after these Commission proceedings.","start":1267.403,"stop":1271.088,"duration":3.68},{"text":"And for that reason we say it would appear that these issues although it have been litigated before the Commission by Transatlantic, if it wanted to get in at that time.","start":1271.088,"stop":1282.604,"duration":11.52},{"text":"It was represented in the Commission proceedings and there's nothing unfair in holding on to that.","start":1282.604,"stop":1288.671,"duration":6.07},{"text":"But if this Court, now this is the third and last part of my argument, does decide that there is something unfair and what's taken place or that Transatlantic in some way that I cannot file them as missed today in court when it was represented by its agent Furness, Withy before the Commission.","start":1288.671,"stop":1309.07,"duration":20.4},{"text":"If this court reaches that point and I would rather hope it will because the issue here on the merits is so important, then the argument is resolved not by looking at the first instance at the Volkswagenwerk case.","start":1309.07,"stop":1329.764,"duration":20.69},{"text":"Not as far as I, as counsel I'm concern because I am arguing that goes with route of the Volkswagenwerk case.","start":1329.764,"stop":1336.474,"duration":6.71},{"text":"You can tell authoritatively what that case means.","start":1336.474,"stop":1340.116,"duration":3.64},{"text":"But I look first to the statute to see what it says.","start":1340.116,"stop":1344.914,"duration":4.8},{"text":"It says that all
