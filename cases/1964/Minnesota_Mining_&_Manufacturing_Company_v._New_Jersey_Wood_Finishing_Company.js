government action under Section 5 (b) whether that action by the Department of Justice or by the Trade Commission.","start":964.442,"stop":983.398,"duration":18.96},{"text":"This led the Third Circuit to take the obvious and less logical step that since the language in Section 5 (b) is so identical, so closely identified with the language of 5 (a) that a Federal Trade Commission proceeding or
