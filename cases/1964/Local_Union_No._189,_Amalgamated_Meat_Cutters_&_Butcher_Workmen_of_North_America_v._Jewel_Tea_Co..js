ten to work through eight?","start":76.89,"stop":80.746,"duration":3.86},{"text":"The flexible workday was one of the major issues discussed between the parties and that issue went to whether -- not to whether the men worked, to when the men would be scheduled into work after 6 o'clock.","start":80.746,"stop":95.854,"duration":15.11},{"text":"The employer's object was to get as they called it a completely flexible workday so that for the men who would work after 6 o'clock, you would schedule them in for work at noon, they would work there eight straight time hour shifts through nine and you
