Superintendent, the District Superintendent Schools to appear at the Superintendent's office to discuss what the Superintendent described on his letter as a matter of importance.","start":87.658,"stop":105.326,"duration":17.67},{"text":"Mr. Beilan of course appeared.","start":105.326,"stop":108.31,"duration":2.98},{"text":"Superintendent told Mr. Beilan at that
