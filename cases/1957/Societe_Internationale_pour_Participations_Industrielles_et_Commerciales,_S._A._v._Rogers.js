order.","start":17.569,"stop":48.693,"duration":31.12},{"text":"I should like to discuss a few of the procedural facts first before I come to the principles of law which I think are controlling here.","start":48.693,"stop":63.428,"duration":14.74},{"text":"This petitioner is a Swiss Holding Corporation which filed suit in 1948 under the Trading with the Enemy Act to recover most of the stock of General Aniline & Film Corporation, an American Company.","start":63.428,"stop":85.538,"duration":22.11},{"text":"The respondents filed answers in which they alleged that the petitioner was \"enemy

Germany\".","start":100.961,"stop":113.972,"duration":13.01},{"text":"Shortly after the complaint was instituted, cross motions were filed for discovery.","start":113.972,"stop":121.658,"duration":7.69},{"text":"And the Court -- the District Court required the custodian to disclose to the petitioner a quantity of some 23,000 relevant documents in its -- his possession.","start":121.658,"stop":136.724,"duration":15.07},{"text":"At the same time, the respondents had moved not only for the discovery of the petitioner's own records and those of a wholly owned subsidiary but the records of a private Swiss bank known as Sturzenegger & Company in Basel, Switzerland with which the petitioner had close business relations.","start":136.724,"stop":160.386,"duration":23.66},{"text":"It was the position of the petitioner that its records were relevant.","start":160.386,"stop":166.774,"duration":6.39},{"text":"It made no resistance to the motion for the production of its own records.","start":166.774,"stop":172.257,"duration":5.48},{"text":"It resisted vigorously the request that it produced the records of the Swiss bank upon the ground that it did not have possession, custody or control of those records as required by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.","start":172.257,"stop":191.752,"duration":19.5},{"text":"We also raised the point with the Court invoking the exercise of a benign discretion that due to the banking secrecy laws of Switzerland, it would be difficult if not impossible even should the bank voluntarily produce -- would be willing to give up the records for us to obtain them for inspection.","start":191.752,"stop":219.655,"duration":27.9},{"text":"We also resisted the imposition of this discovery order as far as the Sturzenegger Bank was concerned upon the ground of an inadequate designation of the records.","start":219.655,"stop":235.323,"duration":15.67},{"text":"And so it happens that this element of control, which we say was never properly resolved against us and the proper designation of the records to be produce are basic difficulties here that appointed us throughout in this whole case.","start":235.323,"stop":256.911,"duration":21.59},{"text":"Judge Laws heard arguments in our position to the production of the Sturzenegger records.","start":256.911,"stop":265.726,"duration":8.81},{"text":"Now, Sturzenegger who was the managing partner of this private Swiss bank is one of the principal directors of the petitioner.Now, I think that had a great influence with the district judge in imposing upon the petitioner a requirement that it produce not only its own records but the records of this private Swiss bank.","start":265.726,"stop":296.308,"duration":30.58},{"text":"Now, prior to the institution of our suit, an agency of the Swiss government known as the Swiss Compensation Office had made an investigation into the national character of both Sturzenegger and the petitioner and several reports were issued in which it was determined that these companies were Swiss in character.","start":296.308,"stop":327.955,"duration":31.65},{"text":"The principal reason I believe why the respondents urge the Court to include in its discovery order against us, the requirement that we produce, the records of the private Swiss bank partnership, was because this business relationship which the petitioner had with the Swiss bank was not only that of having the Swiss bank as its house bank but it also had a participation in the partnership of this bank.","start":327.955,"stop":367.983,"duration":40.03},{"text":"Now, the bank was a -- had two partners and the participation of the petitioner in this case, not the Sturzenegger.","start":367.983,"stop":378.801,"duration":10.82},{"text":"It was the unlimited partner, the general managing partner was a small Swiss Franc investment.","start":378.801,"stop":387.195,"duration":8.39},{"text":"A corporation known as \"Industry Bank,\" which was not a bank but a Swiss corporation, was a limited partner with a large Swiss Franc investment.","start":387.195,"stop":398.492,"duration":11.3},{"text":"And the petitioner in this case had what is known as a \"sleeping participation,” a thing which is unknown to Anglo-Saxon law but has its roots perhaps in German law.","start":398.492,"stop":411.04,"duration":12.55},{"text":"And we have maintained throughout that it is more akin to that of an investment than it is to a sound partner or any kind of a partner.","start":411.04,"stop":422.654,"duration":11.61},{"text":"Now fortunately for us, we did not have to rely upon oral testimony as to the terms of the so-called partnership agreements.There were successively three or four, they have been before the Court, they had written out great detail.","start":422.654,"stop":441.851,"duration":19.2},{"text":"No one has suggestion -- suggested that they are any wise not genuine.","start":441.851,"stop":447.626,"duration":5.77},{"text":"And those agreements spell out this very limited participation of the petitioner, practically no say in the management, a veto on certain kinds of unusual loans.","start":447.626,"stop":463.992,"duration":16.37},{"text":"And upon the point of the ability to see the books and records of the partnership, a very unusual provision exists and that is it provides that the delegates of the respective participants, Industry Bank, the limited partner on the one hand, the petitioner with the participation on the other.","start":463.992,"stop":486.574,"duration":22.58},{"text":"Their delegates could examine the books and records of the partnership but they had to keep secret in which they saw.","start":486.574,"stop":496.608,"duration":10.03},{"text":"Now, a very unusual provision to the point of view of Anglo-Saxon law but one which my implication spells out something of very great importance to us, namely, that the petitioner had no control over the books and records of the bank.","start":496.608,"stop":514.768,"duration":18.16},{"text":"And thus, it was unable to produce them by contract or by law or by any other arrangement in Switzerland.","start":514.768,"stop":527.402,"duration":12.63},{"text":"Despite our resistance of this imposition of this order upon us for discovery, we were ordered in 1949 to produce our own records and those records and the records of the Sturzenegger Bank.We made our examination of the Government's records first.","start":527.402,"stop":545.778,"duration":18.38},{"text":"The deposition of Dr. Sturzenegger which had been in progress prior to that time was resumed and completed to the extent of over 6000 pages of testimony.","start":545.778,"stop":556.101,"duration":10.32},{"text":"We are now reaching the summer of 1950.","start":556.101,"stop":560.289,"duration":4.19},{"text":"At this time, the gentlemen from the Department of Justice are proceeding to Switzerland for the purpose of making inspection which the Court directed.","start":560.289,"stop":569.544,"duration":9.25},{"text":"Before they arrive there about the 15th of June 1950, the Swiss Federal Attorney who is the second man in command of the Justice Department of Switzerland, issued a confiscation order based upon what's called Preventive Police Power in Switzerland and referring to the Bank Secrecy laws and the Economic Espionage laws of Switzerland and expressly seizing and confiscating all the records of the Swiss bank to prevent their disclosure to the Attorney General of the United States in this case.","start":569.544,"stop":613.133,"duration":43.59},{"text":"Now, respondent's counsel examined the records of the petitioner.Now, there is some contest as to whether they saw all of them but that's not in dispute in this proceeding.","start":613.133,"stop":623.812,"duration":10.68},{"text":"In the fall of 1950, a motion to dismiss was filed on the ground that we had not complied with the order for discovery.","start":623.812,"stop":634.674,"duration":10.86},{"text":"And in the hearing before the District Court at that time, the district -- the issue was raised as to whether the petitioner in this case had denied and conspired with the Government of Switzerland for the purpose of procuring this seizure order.","start":634.674,"stop":651.335,"duration":16.66},{"text":"It was also argued that this was an illegal order.","start":651.335,"stop":655.265,"duration":3.93},{"text":"It was also

dealt with the proposition as if it were an actual physical seizure.I think that this Court should regard it as the equivalent of an actual physical seizure.","start":666.896,"stop":693.472,"duration":26.58},{"text":"Justice Laws -- Judge Laws referred this matter to a special Master to take testimony but then ensued a very long proceeding in the cause of which it was found that there was oddly no evidence of any conspiracy between the Swiss Government and the petitioner in this case.","start":693.472,"stop":715.028,"duration":21.56},{"text":"It was found that the seizure was valid under the Preventive Police Power of Switzerland.","start":715.028,"stop":719.905,"duration":4.88},{"text":"It was found that the petitioner in this case had done everything which he could be expected to do to try and have them relieved of the order.","start":719.905,"stop":728.844,"duration":8.94},{"text":"And on the basis of that report, the petitioner moved for its ratification.","start":728.844,"stop":737.664,"duration":8.82},{"text":"The respondents came in and filed exceptions but renewed their motion to dismiss upon the ground that even if it were found that the petitioner were in entire good faith that our inability to produce these records had disrupted the established procedures which were in effect that when a litigant comes into court, it should be prepared to make full disclosure.","start":737.664,"stop":765.452,"duration":27.79},{"text":"And despite our complete inability and our innocence in the situation, the suit should be dismissed.","start":765.452,"stop":772.927,"duration":7.48},{"text":"In February of 1953, Judge Laws wrote an opinion in which he had adopted that philosophy.","start":772.927,"stop":780.339,"duration":7.41},{"text":"He announced however that this was a novel doctrine and that he would give the petitioner an opportunity to try to get the records.","start":780.339,"stop":790.45,"duration":10.11},{"text":"And so he extended the time for approximately three months.","start":790.45,"stop":795.195,"duration":4.75},{"text":"In the meantime, certain petitions have been filed with the Swiss Federal authorities in an effort to try to pry these records loose.","start":795.195,"stop":806.037,"duration":10.84},{"text":"And it began to develop that if we could obtain the waivers and consents from the bank customers who in Swiss -- one of the owners of the banking secret.","start":806.037,"stop":819.923,"duration":13.89},{"text":"Under the supervision of the federal government, these records might be released or some of them might be released.","start":819.923,"stop":827.152,"duration":7.23},{"text":"So we pursued that course for several months in 1953 and we're able to ship over here some 63,000 records within -- sought more time because this is a very tedious process.","start":827.152,"stop":844.421,"duration":17.27},{"text":"And it began to develop but not only did we need the primary records of the custom of the bank -- primary consents of the custom of the bank.","start":844.421,"stop":852.672,"duration":8.25},{"text":"But if to payee of the check was involved, we call that a \"secondary waiver.\"","start":852.672,"stop":858.494,"duration":5.82},{"text":"We needed his waiver and his will.","start":858.494,"stop":861.433,"duration":2.94},{"text":"So in the fall of 1953, on one of our motions to extend the time ought to be relieved upon -- of the order upon the basis of substantial compliance, the Court asked whether we could give any assurance as to whether we could then get full compliance.","start":861.433,"stop":883.019,"duration":21.59},{"text":"I told the district judge that I could not give him that assurance but that I'd never given up hope and that was the opportunity to continue.","start":883.019,"stop":892.846,"duration":9.83},{"text":"Strangely enough and this is a paradox in a case which is full of paradoxes that the district judge said I think from this situation in Switzerland where you lack control that you will never be able to get these records.","start":892.846,"stop":910.858,"duration":18.01},{"text":"So we might as well save you this frustrating effort which you have been making for years and we have just dismissed the case finally.","start":910.858,"stop":918.185,"duration":7.33},{"text":"Now, mind you if the Court please.","start":918.185,"stop":920.093,"duration":1.91},{"text":"The paradox that I referred to is this element of control which Judge Laws had find -- found only prima facie to exist when he issued the order in July of 1949 and which he had defined in order to support the legality of the discovery order under Rule 34.","start":920.093,"stop":942.36,"duration":22.27},{"text":"He found later on that the absence of that control was the reason why we couldn't produce and why we should be dismissed.","start":942.36,"stop":952.846,"duration":10.49},{"text":"Now, as a result of that, we took an appeal to the Court of Appeals and the case was argued and submitted and decided in June of 1955.","start":952.846,"stop":964.393,"duration":11.55},{"text":"It was affirmed in its entirety with the modification allowing us six months from the time that the mandate came down in which we tried to get the records.","start":964.393,"stop":976.923,"duration":12.53},{"text":"Now, we intended to apply for certiorari and we stayed the mandate and did apply to this Court for certiorari.Certiorari was denied in January of 1956.","start":976.923,"stop":991.615,"duration":14.69},{"text":"The six months began to run on the 24th of January 1956 and so we began again previously to -- by this waiver and consent method to get records.","start":991.615,"stop":1004.659,"duration":13.04},{"text":"And by June of 1956, we had produced in this country and tendered for inspection almost 200,000 banking records of the Sturzenegger Bank.","start":1004.659,"stop":1017.633,"duration":12.97},{"text":"Now, I said earlier and I don't want to take too much time on it, our brief is clear on it, that the Court's designation was unclear.","start":1017.633,"stop":1025.328,"duration":7.69},{"text":"There was no designation of all the records of the bank.","start":1025.328,"stop":1028.464,"duration":3.14},{"text":"There was a designation based upon certain language in the Swiss compensation and all the reports.","start":1028.464,"stop":1033.752,"duration":5.29},{"text":"There's a great controversy about how many records we had to produce.","start":1033.752,"stop":1038.372,"duration":4.62},{"text":"There'd be a great controversy as to when we had made full production.I","start":1038.372,"stop":1044.013,"duration":5.64},{"text":"can't assure this Court for 200,000 of the full production but I don't have to use any argument to submit that 200,000 are
