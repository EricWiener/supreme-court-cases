Morrison","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question presented in this case is the Constitutionality of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, or more precisely, the Constitutionality of the process by which those guidelines were issued.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"To answer the question, it is necessary to know how the guideline system works, and what kind of judgments went into the guidelines.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In 1984, Congress instituted a new system of determinative sentencing.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In that determinative sentencing system, it made sentencing guidelines the centerpiece.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"It also recognized that it could not... chose not to issue the guidelines itself.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Rather, it designated in a statute of commission to do the job.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The commission to consist of seven members, three of whom were required to be Article 3 Federal Judges, all of whom were appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and no more than four of them could be members of the same political party.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Now, the term guidelines, which is what the commission is directed to issue, is something of a misnomer.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"These guidelines are not merely advisory.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"They are directions to sentencing judges with which the sentencing judges must comply, unless they find that there is a factor in the particular case which the sentencing commission did not adequately take into account.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And If the sentencing judge diverts from the guidelines, either above or below the guideline, then the party... either the defendant or the Government... has a right of appeal on the grounds that the sentence was unreasonably either too high or too low.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Similarly for the first time ever, both defendant and the Government has a right to appeal if they allege that the Court selected an improper guideline or otherwise misapplied the guidelines.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"There is no dispute between the parties that the guidelines constitute the law of sentencing for Federal defendants from November 1, 1987 on, which is the effective date for the guidelines for crimes committed after that date.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In order to determine whether the guidelines are consistent with separation of powers, it's necessary to examine the kind of judgments that the commission inevitably had to make in establishing a guidelines system.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The first question that the commission had to confront with respect to each of the crimes... and this is not simply the Title XVIII, but all of the entire Federal criminal code, and other provisions in other parts of the United States Code... where should the sentence be?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Congress told the commission that the sentencing range for each sentence could be no more than six months or 25 percent maximum to minimum jail time.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"So, for instance, for the crime of stealing a $500 Social Security check in the mail, the commission had to decide what the appropriate punishment was for that particular crime.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Did it matter the commission had to decide whether the thief was caught before he spent the money, or whether the amount of the check was not $500, but $1,000, and--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Morrison, was the commission circumscribed at all by the outside limits of the penalties already prescribed by law?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Alan B. Morrison","textObjs":[{"text":"--Yes, your Honor.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Yes, your Honor.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The commission also had to decide whether those similar kinds of monetary adjustments were appropriate for other kinds of crimes against property, for crimes such as tax evasion, for price fixing, securities fraud, and the like.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Congress told the commission,","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"\"Start with the average sentences imposed in the past, but that you can move them up or down as you see fit in order to eliminate what Congress said were unwarranted disparities.\"","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"So, the commission had to decide what factors were properly aggravating and what properly mitigating in a particular crime to decide whether the particular differences were warranted or unwarranted.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"That is precisely the kind of process that sentencing judges used to do, before the commission issued its guidelines and they went into effect.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The second major task that the commission had to undertake was it had to rank the seriousness of disparate kinds of offenses.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"It was not simply enough to decide the absolute offence level for each crime, but as a practical matter, you had to rank the crimes in comparative degree of seriousness.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"So for instance, the commission had to face questions rather like this: how should you punish the sale of six ounces of cocaine, the committing of perjury before Congress, bid rigging in excess of $50 million in Government contracts, the sale of $100 in pornographic materials, or conspiracy to violate the civil rights of a Black family.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The commission chose, within the statutory range of sentencing, to treat all of those disparate offenses basically the same, and that question of how to treat them was a question that they had to address, despite the very dissimilar facts surrounding each of the crimes.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"It is of course not the function of the Court to decide whether those analogous sentences for different crimes is right or wrong.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But it's important to note these because it indicates the kind of ranking of judgments that the commission made, these very heavily policy-oriented judgments that are plainly debatable, and that the terms of these debates are about values and about policies, and they are political in the best sense of the word... the kinds of political choices that we normally expect will be made by our political branches.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"This ranking of offenses, is inevitable, any time you have a base level system, which they had to have in this case, between 1 and 43.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And while the guidelines themselves don't show the ranking, the equal ranking of disparate crimes, we have attached an addendue to our brief, which goes through each base level offense and shows you what the commission determined to be similar crimes and hence deserving of similar punishments.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"There are, in short, no neutral principles that the commission could follow, except its own good sense and personal views about which crimes were more serious or less serious than the others.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The commission recognized in a number of places that it was making policy decisions, most particularly in the policy decisions to substantially increase the amount of time which persons convicted of white-collar crime, such as tax evasion, public corruption, anti-trust violations, securities fraud, would spend in jail.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The third set of determinations, that the commission and to make was to decide who gets to go on probation and who doesn't get to go on probation.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Under the statues, the commission was empowered to lay down the ground rules, and say below a certain level, probation is permissible, but above that level, it is not permissible.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And the District Judge who sentences the individual is forbidden from giving probation to someone whom the commission said was not entitled to probation for that kind of crime, just as much as the District Judge is forbidden from going above or below the sentencing guidelines.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"There is, I believe, a graphic example of the effect that the commission's judgments have on sentencing, and how the commission's judgments reflect its views about what kind of penalties are appropriate for what kind of crime.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And The example I refer to is that of the recent sentence of Michael Deaver.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Mr. Deaver was convicted of committing three counts of perjury.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Assume for simplicity it's only one count, because the guidelines become more confusing when there are multiple counts... another matter which the commission had to deal with.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Now, under the commission's guidelines, a single count of perjury is a base level 12 offense.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Because Mr. Deaver had no prior convictions, that would translate into a range of sentence between 10 and 16 months confinement.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Under the commission's guidelines, alcoholism, which was a factor cited in mitigation, would not have been an excuse to go below the 10 months.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"It would have been a proper basis for the judge to consider, within the 10 to 16 month range.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Now, of that 10 months, the sentencing commission said five had to be spent in actual confinement... no straight probation, actual confinement.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And five could have been served in community confinement, which means a person can go out during the day and goes to a halfway house or similar facility in the evening.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In actuality, the District Judge in this case gave Mr. Deaver three years jail time, but suspended it entirely.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Under the sentencing guidelines, he could not have done that.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Now, again, the question is not which set of judgments is right or wrong, the sentencing commission's judgments or the District Court's judgments.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The point for these purposes is to recognize that the judgment depends about your notions about this relative seriousness of the crime.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"What kind of offenses should people in all cases have to go to jail for?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And this commission has made those judgments in every one of the cases in which it has written a sentencing guideline for.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"You take the position that no commission, regardless of its composition, could have been given that power, I take it?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Alan B. Morrison","textObjs":[{"text":"That is the second argument we make.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"We make the argument on delegation as our second argument, given the definitions and the relatively few limits that Congress has placed upon the commission.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"And if we disagree with you on that, then you fall back on the fact that it's the composition of the commission?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Alan B. Morrison","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, as your Honor notes, those are alternative arguments.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"We have placed the sentencing... let me see, the separation of powers argument first in our brief because we believe it is a lesser argument... that is to say, we don't have to say that necessarily you could never issue sentencing guidelines, but that this commission with this composition, these powers and these restrictions couldn't do it.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, would it make a difference if the law did not require that judges serve on the commission?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Alan B. Morrison","textObjs":[{"text":"It would make a difference depending upon whether judges were serving on the commission or not.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, what if the President under a law that didn't specify that judges would have to serve... and what if the President in fact asked some to serve, and they said, \"All right, we will\".","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Alan B. Morrison","textObjs":[{"text":"In my view, that is un-Constitutional as well.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"That is not permissible, to have Article 3 judges serving on commission of this kind.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Even as true volunteers, when it isn't mandated?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Alan B. Morrison","textObjs":[{"text":"I think that... yes, that is also correct, your Honor, because of the nature of the kind of choices that the commission was making.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The thrust of my submission that I have been making here in trying to describe the work of the commission is directly relevant on both the separation of powers issues... because the Court has looked at the functions being performed... as well as the delegation issue, and that factual predicate in this description directly bears on both of them, and not simply on the delegation issue, or on the separation of powers issue.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, what about Owen Roberts on the Pearl Harbor Commission, Earl Warren on the Warren Commission?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Alan B. Morrison","textObjs":[{"text":"I believe that all... that many... that those two are factually distinguishable on the grounds that they involved advice-giving and fact-finding.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But the... both the Government and the sentencing commission cite a number of historic examples about other kinds of activities undertaken by various justices at various times.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"While I think there are some distinctions between that case and this one, principally because this one involves the making of law in a concrete situation... the most important distinction for our purposes is that in none of those examples was the Constitutionality of the conduct ever taken to court, let alone was it reviewed under this Court's jurisprudence on separation of powers as it has evolved since Buckley in 1976.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Do you think that practice amounts to nothing in determining Constitutionality?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Alan B. Morrison","textObjs":[{"text":"I did not say that, your Honor.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"I would not agree that practice amounts to nothing.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"I would point out, however, that there has been practice to the contrary.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"A number of Justices expressed extreme reservations about doing this, and while not directly citing separations of powers situations in all cases... although Justice Stone has done so... I would say that dating from the earliest days of our Republic, when as reported in United States v. Muskrat, President Washington asked Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State to ask the Court for an opinion about the meaning of a treaty.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Those... the Justices declined to do so on the grounds that it was inappropriate.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"I would suspect that it they had been asked in their individual capacities, as the respondent suggests, as opposed to their official capacity, the outcome should have teen the same.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"So, I think that the history is by no means unified all in one direction, but more importantly, I believe that none of the cases ever involved activities of a concrete, far-reaching nature that affects 40,000 criminal defendants a year, as the activities of the sentencing commission do here.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, as long as we're giving you these examples, what about the Federal rules of evidence?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Suppose that this Court had promulgated the Federal rules of evidence.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Would that have been Constitutional?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Alan B. Morrison","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, let me divide the answer into two parts, If I may.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"As to the rules not relating to privilege, I would say that there would be no difficulty, that those are very close to the rules of civil procedure.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"That is, of course, the line that Congress ultimately hit upon.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"This Court did, in the early 1970's, pursuant to a Congressional grant, promulgate the rules of evidence, sent them forward to Congress.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Congress saw them, stopped them from going into effect, and ultimately said,","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"\"You can't put them into effect as to privileges.\"","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Now, dealing with the privileges, I would even divide that into two parts.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"It seems to me that it we are dealing with the privileges as applies to Federal law and Federal causes of action involving Federal matters, that the Court may have some limited authority there.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But what I believe you have, in the case of privileges, are principally questions of value judgments.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Do we value the confidence between the husband and wife greater than we value the getting at truth?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"How do we value the attorney-client privilege... not so much in the context of litigation, but in terms of pre-litigation matters?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And it is my view that that is a far closer question... and I think if I had to come down on it, I would say that the Court could not do these... at least certainly many of the privileges.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"And is the historical occurrence that Congress old enact the privileges support for your position?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Alan B. Morrison","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I would like to say yes, your honor, but I think that it probably had to do more with a recognition of the underlying nature of the controversies in the privilege area... that is, we are dealing with policy choices that are more substantive in nature than procedural.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"I recognize that in recent years the Court has said... I mean, just last term... that there is no single dividing line between substance and procedure.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But, on the other hand, the Court has recognized in a number of cases when persons have tried to claim something as procedural to be able to drag it in on the judicial side, the Court has said,","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"\"No, we won't allow that to take place.\"","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"So, I think that the efforts to expand procedural have... albeit in a different context... have generally not met with favor, and I would think that they would not apply here to the evidence context as well.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Turning back to the work of the commission, the commission also had to deal with the question of fines within the statutory restrictions.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The commission was given the discretion to decide under what circumstances fines should be imposed, when and how much.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Originally the commission thought about having an ability-to-pay fine system, or is the alternative, a system based on a multiplier of the amount of money lost.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The commission is even now about to hold some hearings dealing with fines for organizations, principally corporate defendants.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But, in the end, as to individuals, it's set up a schedule under which all but the incident must pay fines in an amount within the range set forth in the schedule.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"So, turning back again to the Michael Deaver example, at the base level offense of 12, Mr. Deaver could have been required to pay a fine of between $3,000 and $30,000.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In fact, he was fined a $100,000, and again, the answer... the question is, of course, not which set of fines is correct, but it shows how value-laden that part of the system is as well.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Is this argument to say that the commission is treading on judicial, the power of individual judges?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Alan B.
