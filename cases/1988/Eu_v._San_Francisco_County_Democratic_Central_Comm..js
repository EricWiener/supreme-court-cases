Justice Scalia, it does not prevent the members of the committee from communicating with their party.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"What it does is protect to the members of the party the right to participate directly in the choice of candidates without having that--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, couldn't they participate with the recommendation as well?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"I mean, they are just talking about the right to know what the recommendation of the committee as a committee is.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Then they'll be able to accept it or reject it.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Why is that undemocratic?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill","textObjs":[{"text":"--Well, Justice Scalia, the choice, the representation being made on behalf of the committee is typically that this is the party's candidate, and the effect that that can often have is that the choices available to the rest of the members of the party in the primary election are restricted.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"We have a phenomenon in California that's caused a great deal of irritation, the election returns on the national level are reported before our polls close, and it's been established by objective evidence that that affects the turnout in elections.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And we don't get the participation of as many citizens in our election process when they think that their options have been foreclosed, that it's over.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, that's another case.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"You don't want this case to hinge on whether it would be constitutional to prevent election returns from being announced in California, assuming that they are available?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill","textObjs":[{"text":"No, Justice Scalia.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"What we are attempting to demonstrate by that analogy is that the tendency for an endorsement by what purports to be the party, and in California in fact is not the party, the party expresses itself in the primary election.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"That's what the primary election system is all about.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The party leaders--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"It's one thing to outlaw the smoke-filled room and it's another thing to prevent me from knowing what the

Graybill","textObjs":[{"text":"--That doesn't prevent you, Justice Scalia, from knowing what the people in the smoke-filled room recommend.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"They have other means of access through, for example, membership in the California Democratic Council, our declarant, Senator Rodda, indicated any number of unofficial groups of party that get together and make their views known to the electorate.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"This restriction is so minuscule with regard to the First Amendment rights of the individual members of the executive committees or the county central committees or the State Central Committees, the means available to them other than creating the false impression that they speak for the party are readily available.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"So you're saying we should validate it because it isn't needed?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"I don't understand that.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"You say it's minuscule, you can find out other ways, so it's really not important.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, it is important, Justice Kennedy.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"And so you're here at the Supreme Court to defend it because it's not important?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"I don't understand that.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, that is definitely not the case, and the reason it is important is that in California, in the direct primary system, the party, per se, speaks by its vote in the primary election.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"When an official organ of the party, which under the charter of the party, which is reflected in these statutes, precludes them from making those endorsements, you have not only the mandate of the party that created these committees that these committees not try to speak for the party or to restrict the numbers of candidates and options available to the party in the primary election is a justifiable and overriding state interest, and it is narrowly construed to... it is narrowly fashioned not to infringe on the First Amendment rights of individual party leaders to express their views.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"They are just restricted from committing the fraud that exists by virtue of the existence of the California Democratic... the California primary election system.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The parties speak at the primary with regard to who their endorsed candidates are to be for the general election and who the party leadership is to be.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Didn't the party, the Democratic Party, change its by-laws or requirements after the Ninth Circuit acted here to permit pre-primary endorsements by the committee?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill","textObjs":[{"text":"Justice O'Connor.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"I think we should be more precise there.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The executive board of the State Central Committee of the Democratic Party, by a vote which is not clear but could have been as few as 32 out of over 1000 members, decided that matter.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"They did not present it to a vote of the full committee as was the case in Tashjian, and we really don't know what the position of the party is on that.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"I don't think that would be a fair reflection--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Excuse me.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Was it an effective vote?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Are you denying that it was an effective vote, binding on the committee?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill","textObjs":[{"text":"--Under the by-laws, Justice Scalia, as we understand them of the State Central Committee, that would be permissible, yes.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"It was permissible.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"So once again you're, you're trying to impose upon the party some other rule about what, what the... how the party takes action.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"If the Democratic Party of California says 32 votes does it in those circumstances, 32 votes does it, and you're coming and tell us that it doesn't do it?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill","textObjs":[{"text":"No, Your Honor.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"What we are explicating here is that does not reflect the will of the party necessarily.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"There is a process that has been gone through to establish these reforms through the political process.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In other words, interest in the parties, one of their parties organized through the direct primary system, the progressives, the much maligned progressives, they established those things in statute.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The members of the party here that disagree have been unsuccessful in persuading their parties in general, and I think we have to look here that the organization of a party is not the party, per se.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"There are other elements to it.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"There are the, the members of the party elected to the official positions in state government and in the national

politicians.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Do you agree to that?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I think that that's correct, Justice Marshall.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"I think we're, we're dealing with politicians throughout this lawsuit.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The

terminology.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill","textObjs":[{"text":"--Justice O'Connor, the committee purports to speak for those, for others that are not

its views, for whatever it's worth, how can that be some minimal right?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill","textObjs":[{"text":"--Justice O'Connor, it would still remain our contention at this point that the change in the by-laws is not necessarily reflective of the will of the party.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"It appears... and we have to acknowledge that under the circumstances that this case has gotten here, the record isn't as complete as we would like, but we believe that the mechanism of a change in the by-laws and a submission to the legislature which determines... these are people that were nominated by members of the party in the primary election and elected... make a determination of whether this really is reflective of the will of the party.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And there is an example--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, what was the will of the party before the amendment?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill","textObjs":[{"text":"--The amendment to the by-laws, Justice

White--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"It still was just as much of a, just as much of a restriction on the speech, no matter what the by-laws said, unless the by-laws absolutely forbade it, which it didn't... they didn't.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Geoffrey Lloyd Graybill","textObjs":[{"text":"--Your Honor, we have referred in the record and established in the record, and I don't think it's rebutted here, that the political culture of California, the expression of First Amendment rights by the parties themselves indicates that they don't want their institutions making endorsements, and this goes back before the advent of the primary election system.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"This was the way Californians did business in the convention era, as was reflected in the opinion of the Attorney General--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well,

not, in fact, made those endorsements since they've become a ballot-qualified party.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, because they had to change their whole system once they became ballot-qualified.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"They also changed their whole manner of electing delegates and went to a county system instead of a regional system, right?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"I mean, that doesn't prove anything.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"It just proves that they've been obeying the
