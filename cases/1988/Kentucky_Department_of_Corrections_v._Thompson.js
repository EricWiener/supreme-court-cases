Helms before visitation was suspended or revoked, and that is a notice opportunity to be... opportunity to respond.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"On appeal, the Sixth Circuit concluded that the procedures themselves were mandatory in character, substantively limited the discretion of the state official by enumerating particularized standards or criteria, and created to protect the liberty interest, thus requiring the implementation of due process procedures.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The Sixth Circuit then remanded the case back to the district court for directions in accordance with its mandate.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"When determining whether state procedures create a... protect the liberty interest, the Commonwealth is urging that this Court draw a line between those procedures which affect the daily management of a prison from those procedures which affect length of confinement, release from confinement, or those procedures which dramatically alter the very nature of confinement.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"When state procedures are drafted which affect--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"What do you include in that last category?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"It isn't clear to me what you have in mind--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Barbara Willett Jones","textObjs":[{"text":"--The kinds--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"--with the nature of confinement.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Barbara Willett Jones","textObjs":[{"text":"--The kinds of things that we see in terms of nature of confinement are the kinds of...

that just address daily policy programs between those procedures which affect substantive areas of incarceration, then you're allowing the state to draft procedures that are very directory in nature

when you're dealing with a suspect class, that you couldn't separate inmates on the basis of race alone.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And, although this Court has not addressed sex discrimination cases, those are the only cases that I'm familiar with as they address in a penal setting.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Maybe I'm too broadly interpreting the equal protection clause, but that's the way I understand it.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Now, I think the other thing that is important, Your Honor, is that the inmate is not without administrative or state law remedies in a situation where state officials don't conform themselves with their own state policies and procedures.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In the Commonwealth, and I think it's very typical in other states, there are mandamus actions that individuals can bring if the duties that are set out in the state regulation or state law are so

position.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I think you are.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"You're saying there no constitutional

all.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Therefore, the rights you're seeking to vindicate... is one to simply say I'm sorry, I know you're curious, but we're not going to tell you.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Barbara Willett Jones","textObjs":[{"text":"--That is what the position

Willett Jones","textObjs":[{"text":"--That's correct.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But what we're also suggesting to this Court is this principle of law that was applied by the Sixth Circuit to this fact situation, carried to its logical conclusion, will require every procedure that addresses the daily operation of a prison to create federally protected rights, so that the state is going to have to implement some kind of due process almost in every situation.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And the examples that we have given the Court are those library procedures that are even more mandatory if you're going to interpret our procedures as mandatory.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The library procedures say that we will not deny an inmate access to the library unless he doesn't return the books.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"That has a shall/unless combination that has pretty much been looked upon by the courts below as the mandatory-type language that creates these rights.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And we're saying that if we don't... if the Court doesn't draw a line and make a distinction between procedures that are daily management-type procedures versus procedures which affect certain areas of incarceration, then we've got a very serious problem, and the state only has two choices: They can accept that ruling and continue to operate with very detailed mandatory directory procedures, or they can choose to write no procedures at all, which is not the choice of state officials.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, Mrs. Jones, isn't there a possible third solution, like in your library... to simply reword the regulation so that it's... it's... gives some more discretion to the officials.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Maybe, this isn't what you really want to do, but certainly that would avoid the conclusion that it creates a liberty interest.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Barbara Willett Jones","textObjs":[{"text":"Certainly the state can reword the procedures.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"What happens when you reword the procedure to allow total discretion, you have deluded one of the purposes of the procedures.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The purpose of the procedure is to direct staff so that they can operate the program.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"It allows for control and discipline to maintain security in the institution.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"If you allow total... if you diluted the procedure to such an extent that you've allowed total discretion, then I don't think you've served the purpose of... of the prison--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"And probably not the purpose of the consent decree.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Barbara Willett Jones","textObjs":[{"text":"--That's correct.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In this instance, it wouldn't serve the purpose of the consent decree.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But you've also allowed the state officials to carve out the contours of a federally protected right, just by semantical or mechanical word change.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, but... you're talking about a federally protected right.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Are we still talking about a right created by these regulations?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Yes.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Barbara Willett Jones","textObjs":[{"text":"They could be, yes.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, then, it's not... it's not really a federally created right.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Barbara Willett Jones","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, if I'm using it in an improper term, I apologize.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But what we're saying is by the way they're written, they are interpreted as being a liberty interest protected by the due process clause, and maybe that's a shorthand term.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"But I take it you would like to carve out some of these and get less federal supervision.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Barbara Willett Jones","textObjs":[{"text":"We would like to have a line drawn and distinctions made between certain procedures so that's... I'm sorry... so that the state could feel free to write very directory-specific procedures that address daily management problems and if they affect certain areas and they want it to be very nondiscretionary in nature, they are accepting liability for a failure to conform in conjunction with that.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"So, you don't want it limited to rules and regulations that affect the basic type of incarceration or the time, the length of incarceration?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Barbara Willett Jones","textObjs":[{"text":"That would... those would be included.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Those procedures that--","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"What else?","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"Barbara Willett Jones","textObjs":[{"text":"--Good time, those type of procedures like Wolff v.
