to the Fifth Circuit, arguing that although Keeble required the giving of an instruction on the lesser included offense, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to enter a judgment of conviction on that offense, and this is in response to Mr. Justice Stevens.","start":328.695,"stop":347.441,"duration":18.75},{"text":"We have suggested that if the Court accepts our position on these lands as

here.","start":364.772,"stop":372.039,"duration":7.27},{"text":"In any event, the Fifth Circuit did not reach the issue but asked the Department of Justice to file a brief discussing whether the crime occurred in Indian country at all.","start":372.039,"stop":380.592,"duration":8.55},{"text":"The Department of Justice took the position in its brief, a position with which respondent agreed, that the crime did occur in Indian country, but the Fifth Circuit disagreed, for reasons that I will discuss shortly, and reversed the convictions.","start":380.592,"stop":395.27,"duration":14.68},{"text":"Meanwhile, after the federal prosecution was completed, state authorities also obtained an indictment against John for exactly the same offense, charging aggravated assault under the Mississippi statutes.","start":395.27,"stop":407.347,"duration":12.08},{"text":"He moved to dismiss the indictment on grounds that the Federal

imprisonment.","start":412.096,"stop":417.437,"duration":5.34},{"text":"The Mississippi Supreme Court, in a decision that was actually rendered before the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
