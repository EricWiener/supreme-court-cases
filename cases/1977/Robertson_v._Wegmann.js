Courts, refusing to apply the state law of survivorship to this case pursuant to Section 1988, since that law would not permit this action to continue and instead fabricating out of new cloth, a federal common law of absolute survivorship brings to our mind the dissenting opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Burger in the Nixon case when he said Mr. Justice Holmes speaking of a tendency of great

is quite different from the matter of recoverable damages which was the question we believe sought to be presented to this Court in Jones vs. Hildebrandt and as to which they have been established

Weir.","start":426.487,"stop":454.53,"duration":28.04},{"text":"As to survivorship of actions however, we reiterate there has never been any such federal rule to be

the principle of abatement of actions upon death of the injured person must come from legislation.","start":461.76,"stop":479.791,"duration":18.03},{"text":"That is certainly as much an American rule

cause.","start":529.683,"stop":562.218,"duration":32.53},{"text":"Thus as the Appellate Courts in the 4th Circuit in Dean vs. Shirer, the 5th in the Brazier case, the 6th in Hall vs. Wooten in opinion written by the present Solicitor General and the 7th in Spence vs. Sterris have all recognized that Congress in enacting Section 1988 of the Civil Rights Act had adopted the state law of the forum as the Federal Law or Federal Common Law of survivorship of civil rights action.","start":562.218,"stop":597.133,"duration":34.92},{"text":"Amicus in its brief filed with the Court, simply clouds the
