the Capper-Volstead Act were steadfastly opposed to the Phipps Amendment and it was defeated, but they were opposed, because it seemed to them that it went far beyond that narrow focus, that narrow concern that they had and it's instructive, that whole incident is instructive to us for several reasons.","start":2502.442,"stop":2525.717,"duration":23.28},{"text":"One, it was quite clear as the result of the debates that pre-planting contracts, the kind of arrangement for the sale of the crop in advance of planting was not sufficient to make those processors, farmers under the Capper-Volstead Act as that Congress sought even though that meant that the processors bore much of the risk of market fluctuation up and down.","start":2525.717,"stop":2550.257,"duration":24.54},{"text":"It also showed that the Congress thought an exemption or an amendment to the Bill then on the floor was required to exempt those

that Congress saw as the difficulty of the farmer.","start":2550.257,"stop":2574.175,"duration":23.92},{"text":"And so the defeat of the amendment is important, indeed it's regarded significant by this Court in the Case-Swayne opinion and the reasons for the defeat are crucial because in effect it shows that Congress wanted to narrowly focus the exemption as much out of concern for consumers down their distribution chain as out of concern for the farmers themselves.","start":2574.175,"stop":2599.18,"duration":25},{"text":"Now the theme, the general theme of the language plus the legislative history was precisely the exercise of this Court went through in Case-Swayne which we regard as definitive in the explication of this amendment, this exemption and let me just call attention to three or four things in connection with Case-Swayne.","start":2599.18,"stop":2623.6,"duration":24.42},{"text":"As we mentioned earlier, given the fact that two of the members of NBMA are

that.","start":2623.6,"stop":2645.982,"duration":22.38},{"text":"Once you look at the reports, particularly House Report Number 24, which is sided in our Brief, the debates which are mentioned in our Brief and recounted in Case-Swayne, the Phipps Amendment which is set out in a footnote in Case-Swayne, you come, it seems to me inevitably to the conclusion that these kinds of processors, the processors that were orange processors in Case-Swayne and one similar to that in this case are not farmers within the Capper-Volstead Act.","start":2645.982,"stop":2680.977,"duration":34.99},{"text":"And then the conclusion that Case-Swayne reaches is particularly instructive.","start":2680.977,"stop":2687.352,"duration":6.38},{"text":"What it says is that you could, it seems to the authors of the opinion, expand the exemption.","start":2687.352,"stop":2694.423,"duration":7.07},{"text":"You could interpret it broadly, but because the purpose of Congress in enacting the Capper-Volstead Act was to create a special

384.","start":2694.423,"stop":2717.639,"duration":23.22},{"text":"So we argue strongly that NBMA members are not farmers, because they do not meet the twin standards, ownership of the land or working at the land and if that is the determining standard, both in the language, producers of agricultural products as farmers, it's the determining standard in the legislative history, you simply cannot
