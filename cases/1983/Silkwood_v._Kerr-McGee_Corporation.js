Oklahoma, the district court, upon finding that there was evidence to support a verdict, was required to submit the punitive damage issue to the jury and said that it was required to do so.","start":464.184,"stop":480.827,"duration":16.64},{"text":"It submitted it in the words of the statute, and the jury found a violation in reliance on that

affecting such vital interests of its citizens as those involved here. \"","start":512.426,"stop":526.027,"duration":13.6},{"text":"Now, in Oklahoma the only state law that the court could have been

did.","start":563.761,"stop":572.697,"duration":8.94},{"text":"And as the Solicitor General acknowledges, appellate jurisdiction exists if the invalidity of the state statute was a necessary predicate for the court of appeals decision, and we think it was.","start":572.697,"stop":585.763,"duration":13.07},{"text":"Now, turning to the issue on the merits, the preemption issue, we're dealing here with a state's right to punish, to punish conduct that injures people and that injures people and is accompanied by a particularly reprehensible state of mind... either the deliberate infliction of injury or the infliction of injury with a reckless disregard for the safety of the state's citizens.","start":585.763,"stop":622.328,"duration":36.56},{"text":"Now, this kind of punishment, this civil punishment, if you will, punitive damages, has been a traditional element of the tort law in 46 states of this country and is still in the tort law of 46 states.","start":622.328,"stop":639.398,"duration":17.07},{"text":"And what it is designed to do lies at the core of the state's interest, that the police power is designed to protect people against reprehensible conduct, very much as the criminal law is.","start":639.398,"stop":653.857,"duration":14.46},{"text":"And the question we have here is whether Congress in enacting the Atomic Energy Act

action.","start":667.097,"stop":669.017,"duration":1.92},{"text":"It is a remedy available in the traditional tort action.","start":669.017,"stop":672.48,"duration":3.46},{"text":"And, of course, the answer is wholly one of congressional intent.","start":672.48,"stop":677.532,"duration":5.05},{"text":"We approach that question with certain assumptions that this Court has stated are always the starting point for analysis.","start":677.532,"stop":686.46,"duration":8.93},{"text":"First, an attempt to preempt a traditional state right is never lightly presumed.","start":686.46,"stop":693.323,"duration":6.86},{"text":"That is especially so when the state right is exercised in the form of tort actions.","start":693.323,"stop":700.269,"duration":6.95},{"text":"This court has said that.","start":700.269,"stop":702.53,"duration":2.26},{"text":"And it is, we would suggest, uniquely so in this case.","start":702.53,"stop":707.503,"duration":4.97},{"text":"Never in the jurisprudence of this nation, not in this Court, not in any other court, has there ever before been a holding that Congress left compensatory damages unpreemptive and yet preempted the punitive damages in that very same cause of action.","start":707.503,"stop":729.718,"duration":22.21}]},{"speakerName":"William H. Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"--Yet, Mr. Gottesman, the position you take that punitive damages are primarily to punish suggests, at least in your view, that the punitive damages serve a much different purpose than compensatory damages, which I suppose are just to make whole.","start":729.718,"stop":746.138,"duration":16.42}]},{"speakerName":"Michael H.
