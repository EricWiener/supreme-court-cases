The trial court had not adopted a clear and convincing evidence standard, and Cruzan's observations that she did not want to live life as a \"vegetable\" did not deal in terms with withdrawal of medical treatment or of hydration and nutrition. 3. The Due Process Clause does not require a State to accept the \"substituted judgment\" of close family members in the absence of substantial proof that their views reflect the patient's. This Court's decision upholding a State's favored treatment of traditional family relationships, Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U.S. 110, may not be turned into a constitutional requirement that a State must recognize the primacy of these relationships in a situation like this.
